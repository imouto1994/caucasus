********************
Having finished writing everything, he set down his brush.
This is enough—this will do.
Rather than wasting away from disease, he chose a death with pride.
$ Sitting shallowly in the chair, he let out a breath.
He was beyond exhausted.
His body felt heavy, like lead.
But even so, one final task remained.
He moved his failing body back to the bedroom and picked up the hemp rope he had prepared.
He tied loops on both ends, securing one side to the leg of the bed.
He opened the window.
The sky was choked with grey clouds.
$ He picked up a single snowdrop flower that had been resting in a vase.
In the end, he could find no hope for himself.
However, he could entrust that hope to those he was leaving behind.
$ He placed the rope around his neck and stood upon the window ledge.
Goodbye, my beloved daughters—
Hanging by the window, his body swayed in the wind.
He departed before the pain could even take hold.
Holding only that single snowdrop.
$ From the overcast sky, white flakes began to drift down.
The world was being filled with white snow.
It was as if an angel had come to take him home.

********************
The snow that had been falling since just after noon quickly buried the traces of the path left on the ground.
Looking back, only the intermittent trail of our own footprints remained.
There was no one behind me.
Far ahead of me walked Kirihara-senpai—Souko-san.
#Protagonist
"Wait up, Souko-san."
#Souko
"What is it~?"
#Protagonist
"I said wait! I'm carrying your bags too, you know!"
#Souko
"It can't be helped, can it? I *am* injured, after all."
Souko-san walked back toward me.
#Protagonist
"Calling it an injury is a bit much. You just bumped your hand against a tree when you slipped and fell."
#Souko
"It hurts, and if it hurts, it hurts! There's nothing to be done about it."
Souko-san clutched her right hand and groaned with exaggerated flair.
#Protagonist
"Even so, you only hit your pinky. Surely you can at least carry your own rucksack?"
#Souko
"Weren't you the one who said, 'Souko-san, if it's too difficult, shall I carry your luggage for you'?"
#Protagonist
"Well, yeah, I did say that, but..."
#Souko
"Then there's no problem, right?"
#Protagonist
"But Souko-san, your rucksack is insanely heavy! It’s way heavier than mine."
#Souko
"When a girl goes on a trip, she inevitably ends up with a lot of things to bring along."
#Protagonist
"Normal girls don't carry around this much bottled cola. Exactly how many are in here?"
#Souko
"I stocked up at the station at the foot of the mountain, so there should still be a dozen left, I think."
#Protagonist
"Give me a break..."
They'd been clinking and clanking noisily on my back for a while now.
#Souko
"Once we find a place to settle down, I'll drink some, so it should get a bit lighter."
#Protagonist
"Where on this snowy mountain do you expect us to 'settle down'?"
I looked up and scanned our surroundings.
A landscape of unbroken white.
On one side, a steep slope stretched endlessly upward.
As for the other side, a slope continued just as far down.
We were on a narrow path, less than a meter wide, where one slip would send you tumbling down.
#Protagonist
"Hey, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Hmm?"
#Protagonist
"Are you absolutely sure this is the right way?"
#Souko
"...Of course it is."
#Protagonist
"Why did you hesitate for a second?"
#Souko
"There's no way I'd make a mistake."
#Protagonist
"Well, I know you're famous at the university for being brilliant, so I'd like to think you wouldn't be wrong, but..."
#Souko
"The direction is correct. I'm certain that if we keep going straight this way, we'll reach Nanatsuki Village."
Souko-san pointed further down the path.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
#Souko
"What?"
#Protagonist
"Have you ever heard the saying 'haste makes waste'?"
#Souko
"Of course I have."
#Protagonist
"I wish you'd consider taking a path that's actually easy to walk on."
#Souko
"But I thought it was a shortcut."
#Protagonist
"Please don't try to act cute all of a sudden."
#Souko
"Yeah, that even felt a bit gross to me."
#Protagonist
"Good grief... where's the map?"
#Souko
"A map? I don't have one."
#Protagonist
"Huh?"
#Souko
"I memorized the terrain around here before we came. The river flowing through this valley we're walking in... if you follow it all the way down, it connects to the Kitakami River."
#Protagonist
"But we're heading upstream right now."
#Souko
"Exactly. And if you go upstream, you reach Nanatsuki Village."
#Protagonist
"I can trust you on that, right?"
#Souko
"Of course. If you really can't trust me, you're free to go home."
#Protagonist
"Don't be ridiculous."
#Souko
"It's a joke. I'd be in trouble if I lost my cola porter."
#Protagonist
"So I'm just a cola mule now?"
#Souko
"Well, you were the one who insisted on coming along for this investigation, weren't you?"
#Protagonist
"Well, yeah, that's true, but..."
It's no use.
I simply can't win against this woman.
It all started when she—Souko Kirihara, my senior in the folklore seminar—announced she wanted to research the unusual customs of the Tohoku region.
Souko-san's interest was piqued by legends remaining in mountain villages, distinct from the 'Tales of Tono' by Kunio Yanagita.
The settlement, known as 'Nanatsuki Village,' has reportedly been ruled for generations by the Nanatsuki clan since the middle of the Edo period.
Apparently, the first head of the family was a major Westernophile; he was devoted to foreign magic and occultism, smuggling various items into Japan while the country was still secluded.
Perhaps because of that, Western-style legends survived in Nanatsuki Village and have been passed down to this day.
Of course, I have no idea how much of it is actually true.
It's only natural for rumors to be embellished—or so Souko-san always says.
Some theories even claim there are Western occult books brought back in secret by the Keicho Embassy, which Date Masamune dispatched under Hasekura Tsunenaga.
It seems Souko-san wants to uncover the truth behind those stories during this investigation.
However...
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
#Souko
"What?"
#Protagonist
"Is it just me, or are we actually stranded out here?"
The wind and snow grew even more intense, until I could barely see a few meters ahead.
#Souko
"You're imagining things."
Souko-san, with snow even clinging to her eyebrows, looked away.
#Protagonist
"You really ought to do something about that haphazard personality of yours."
#Souko
"Oh, shut it. We're on a mountain in the snow; can't we just enjoy ourselves?"
#Protagonist
"This feels less like a hike and more like a forced march through the snow."
I tried to make a joke of it, but it might not have been a very funny one given the circumstances.
#Souko
"Admittedly, this is getting a bit rough."
Souko-san stopped at a level spot.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, is your hand okay?"
#Souko
"Mm, I still have some sensation in it, at least."
She breathed onto her gloved hands.
#Protagonist
"I wish we could find somewhere to get out of the wind."
It felt like even the inside of my nose was freezing over.
I eventually slipped the rucksack off my shoulders and set it on the snow.
#Souko
"Don't let the cola freeze. It'll taste awful."
#Protagonist
"Can we at least worry about ourselves for a change?"
#Souko
"My intuition tells me we should be reaching Nanatsuki Village soon... Hmm?"
#Protagonist
"Is something wrong?"
#Souko
"Did you hear something just now?"
#Protagonist
"Huh?"
At her words, I strained my ears to listen.
I heard nothing but the howling wind.
#Souko
"Was that an animal?"
I still couldn't hear a thing.
#Souko
"A horse... maybe?"
#Protagonist
"Out here?"
#Souko
"Oh, look. It's coming from over there."
Souko-san pointed behind me.
I turned my attention in that direction.
From beyond the swirling blizzard, I heard the faint, distant neighing of a horse.
#Protagonist
"It definitely is coming from that way... let's check it out."
We pushed through the heavy snow.
We emerged onto what looked like a road.
In the distance, a gray shadow appeared.
#Protagonist
"A carriage...?"
What I’d taken for gray was only because it was obscured by the blowing snow.
As it drew closer, I realized it was a carriage painted pitch black.
The horse was pure white, its nostrils huffing clouds of steam.
Between the stark colors and the mode of transport itself, it felt incredibly out of place.
With a soft whinny, the horse came to a halt in front of us.
The driver, reins in hand, looked down at us with a bewildered expression.
Well, anyone would be puzzled to find two people turned into human snowmen in the middle of these mountains.
#???
"Is something the matter?"
The voice came from inside the carriage.
A woman opened the window slightly, squinting against the biting wind as she looked at me.
#Protagonist
"Ah, well... we seem to have lost our way..."
#???
"Oh dear, that is quite a predicament."
With those words, the woman opened the carriage door.
The person who emerged was a young woman about the same age as me.
#???
"Where were you intending to go?"
#Protagonist
"A place called Nanatsuki Village, near here."
I answered, flustered by her refined demeanor.
#???
"Oh... whatever shall we do?"
She touched her hand to her lips and looked back in the direction the carriage had come from.
#???
"The center of the village is at least ten kilometers away from here."
#Protagonist
"Ten kilometers..."
Feeling a wave of dizziness, I glanced at Souko-san.
She looked away.
#???
"Do you have business in the village?"
#Protagonist
"Yes, well... we're students from a university in Tokyo, researching folklore."
#???
"Oh, so you're students?"
Though she was likely around our age, her old-fashioned way of speaking made her seem much older.
#Souko
"We're researching the legends of Nanatsuki Village."
Souko-san chimed in.
#???
"The village legends... In that case, I believe it would be better for you to come to my home rather than heading into the village proper."
#Protagonist
"To your... home?"
#???
"I've been remiss in introducing myself. I am Benio, the second daughter of the Nanatsuki family. It is a pleasure to meet you."
#Protagonist
"The Nanatsuki family...?"
#Souko
"The clan that has ruled Nanatsuki Village for generations."
#Benio
"Oh my... 'ruled' is such a strong word. We have simply lived on this land since ancient times."
Benio-san gave a light, melodic laugh.
I suppose that was what they call a refined upbringing.
#Souko
"But well, it might be for the best to accept your hospitality."
Souko-san shrugged, clutching both hands in front of her chest as she spoke.
I wondered if the hand she’d bumped earlier was still bothering her.
#Protagonist
"Is it really alright?"
#Benio
"Yes, I don't mind at all. The snow is supposed to get heavier, and you'll freeze if you stay out here."
With that, she beckoned us inside.
#Protagonist
"After you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Thank you."
Souko-san brushed the snow off her winter gear and climbed into the carriage first.
I handed both our bags to the driver, who had stepped down to help, and then I climbed into the carriage myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1700.txt
********************
The interior was incomparably warmer than the outside.
#Benio
"Please, do make yourselves comfortable."
As told, I took a seat opposite her, next to Souko-san.
The carriage swayed slightly as it began to move.
#Benio
"Are you two a couple?"
#Souko
"We're not."
Souko-san denied it without a moment's hesitation.
Well, that's only natural, but still.
#Souko
"He's just my assistant. Ah, I'm Souko Kirihara."
#Benio
"Kirihara-san. And you?"
#Protagonist
"I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Benio
"I see. And where did you walk from?"
#Protagonist
"From the station at the foot of the mountain."
#Benio
"My... if you were coming from there, it would have been much faster to take a bus from the city."
#Protagonist
"Is that so? I was told it was closer from the base."
Of course, the one who told me that was Souko-san, who was now sitting silently beside me.
#Benio
"Still, it's a wonder you made it this far. Summer is one thing, but people go missing in these mountains every winter."
#Souko
"See? My sense of direction wasn't wrong, was it?"
#Protagonist
"Don't 'see' me."
#Benio
"Hehe... the two of you are very lucky."
#Protagonist
"You think so?"
#Benio
"Yes. No one uses this path but us. Even then, only once every few days. I can only think of it as a stroke of incredible good fortune."
#Souko
"How much longer until we reach the mansion?"
#Benio
"Let's see..."
Benio-san cast her gaze out the window.
#Benio
"We're approaching a patch of snowdrops, so in this weather, perhaps another thirty minutes."
#Protagonist
"Snowdrops?"
#Benio
"Yes, they're also known as 'Matsuyukisou.' They bloom around February or March."
#Protagonist
"Huh..."
So there are flowers that bloom in this kind of season.
#Souko
"The language of flowers... hope and consolation, wasn't it?"
#Benio
"Yes, you're quite well-informed. ...But are you aware there's another, hidden meaning?"
#Protagonist
"A hidden meaning?"
#Benio
"In certain parts of England, they are apparently treated as a symbol of death."
#Protagonist
"Even though they also mean hope?"
#Benio
"Indeed. A flower that must never be given to another—for it carries the meaning of wishing for the recipient's death."
#Protagonist
"...That's a bit creepy."
#Souko
"It's not like the flower itself is poisonous, so it's fine."
Just as Souko-san said that, the carriage stopped swaying.
#Coachman
"Lady Benio, we have arrived."
The coachman's voice drifted in from outside, muffled by the wind.
#Benio
"I understand."
She gave a short reply and then turned back toward us.
#Benio
"From here, we must proceed on foot. Please bear with it for just a little longer."
#Protagonist
"Right."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1730.txt
********************
When we stepped out of the carriage, a bridge stood directly before us.
It was an old wooden suspension bridge that looked as if it might rot and collapse at any moment.
#Benio
"My home is just on the other side."
She spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
#Protagonist
"The other side, you say..."
The suspension bridge creaked and groaned as it swayed.
It wasn't exactly a sheer cliff, but if I slipped and fell, there was no way I'd survive.
#Benio
"The carriage cannot go any further than this, you see."
Benio-san checked the luggage the coachman had unloaded from the carriage.
#Benio
"Three days from now, then."
#Coachman
"Yes, ma'am. I'll be bringing the fuel then."
#Benio
"Right. If anything else is needed, I shall call. I'm counting on you."
#Coachman
"Understood, Lady Benio."
The coachman bowed and climbed back into the carriage.
#Souko
"She's quite something, isn't she?"
Souko-san whispered into my ear.
#Protagonist
"She definitely has the air of a high-born lady."
#Souko
"It’s like she was born knowing exactly how to command others."
#Protagonist
"Aren't you pretty much the same, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"I am most certainly not. Anyway, never mind that—go help her with her bags."
Souko-san poked me in the back, nudging me toward Benio-san.
#Protagonist
"Ah, Benio-san, would you like me to carry those for you?"
#Benio
"Oh no, I couldn't possibly ask a guest to do such a thing."
#Souko
"Please, don't hesitate to use him. His physical stamina is about the only thing he can be proud of."
#Protagonist
"That's not true at all."
#Benio
"Hehe... and yet, isn't he already carrying your luggage as well?"
#Souko
"It's light, so it's fine."
Actually, Souko-san, that cola of yours is incredibly heavy.
#Benio
"You really don't have to push yourself, you know?"
#Protagonist
"I don't think I'm overdoing it, but..."
With my rucksack and Souko-san's on my back, I took Benio-san's bags in both hands.
I could manage to walk, but crossing that suspension bridge like this was a little terrifying.
#Souko
"Were you out doing some shopping?"
#Benio
"Yes. Normally our maid handles it, but I had some errands of my own to attend to in the city."
#Souko
"It must be difficult, traveling from all the way out here."
#Benio
"Quite. In the summer, one can drive a car up this far, but once the snow piles up, that's no longer an option."
#Protagonist
"Can a carriage climb higher than a car?"
#Souko
"Horses are much better for snowy roads. A car would just slide all over the place."
#Benio
"Exactly. Shall we proceed, then?"
Benio-san began to walk.
I followed behind her, staggering slightly.
As we neared the suspension bridge, the sense of dread only intensified.
#Protagonist
"...It would be a disaster if someone fell, wouldn't it?"
#Souko
"Is there no other way in?"
#Benio
"There is none. If this bridge were to be destroyed, we would be completely isolated."
Benio-san gave a melodic little laugh.
#Protagonist
"I really don't think that's something to laugh about."
I carefully watched my step as I slowly made my way across the bridge.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
I called out to Souko-san behind me.
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Don't even think about pushing me from behind, even as a joke."
#Souko
"I won't. It would be a catastrophe if my cola fell."
I wish she’d worry about me just a little bit.
#Souko
"The wind is so strong..."
The snow was blowing almost horizontally.
#Benio
"Once we cross the bridge and pass through the woods, we'll be right there. Please bear with it for a moment longer."
#Protagonist
"I'm fine, but..."
I wondered if Souko-san's hand was alright.
Having finished crossing the suspension bridge, I let out a sigh of relief.
A line of trees stood ahead of us, with a narrow path winding between them.
I still couldn't see any buildings from here.
#Souko
"Is the place up ahead the 'Nanatsuki-kan'?"
#Benio
"That seems to be what it is called in the village."
#Protagonist
"Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"Apparently, it's not written with the character for 'moon,' but with the one for 'haunt' or 'possess.'"
#Benio
"The Nanatsuki family originally used that character, I am told. Though it was changed several generations ago because the name was considered quite unlucky."
#Protagonist
"Well, the moon in the sky is certainly much prettier."
#Benio
"Indeed it is."
Once we entered the woods, the wind and snow seemed to calm down somewhat.
#Benio
"Are you familiar with the appearance of the Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"I've heard stories. Something about it being built by an architect from abroad."
#Benio
"It was apparently built shortly after the start of the Meiji era. At the time, there were no other Western-style mansions of this scale in the Tohoku region."
Benio-san began her explanation as she walked slowly.
#Benio
"It is said that the head of the family at the time was so enamored with a building he saw overseas that he had a replica built here."
#Protagonist
"What does it look like?"
#Benio
"Well, it would be best for you to see it for yourselves."
Benio-san raised her arm and pointed ahead.
Through a break in the trees, something like a black mountain appeared.
It was a building whose outer walls were painted jet black.
Its overwhelming presence was such that one could never lose sight of it, no matter how the snow raged.
It looked like a void of darkness, as if a piece of the world had been hollowed out right there.
A large clock was mounted high above the entrance.
#Protagonist
"So this is the Nanatsuki-kan..."
#Benio
"It is quite unusual, is it not? Even now, many strange artifacts remain within."
#Souko
"I wonder if those are what gave rise to the legends."
#Benio
"Perhaps. If the opportunity arises, I shall tell you all about them."
Benio-san wore an indescribable smile.
#Benio
"But before that, we must see to your exhaustion. And it seems Kirihara-san is injured as well."
#Souko
"You noticed?"
Souko-san seemed a little surprised.
#Benio
"I noticed you were shielding your hand for some time now. Our family doctor is in residence here, so it would be best to have him examine it later."
#Souko
"I see. Thank you."
#Benio
"Now then, welcome... to the Nanatsuki-kan."
Benio-san gave a graceful bow, gesturing toward the jet-black mansion towering before us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1800.txt
********************
Brushing the accumulated snow off our winter gear, we stepped inside the Nanatsuki-kan.
The entrance hall was spacious, with a vaulted ceiling that reached up to the second floor.
While there was little in the way of gaudy decoration, the furniture placed subtly throughout was clearly of high quality.
Unlike the exterior, it gave off a very calm impression.
Perhaps it was due to the monochrome color scheme.
Even so, to a commoner like me, the overwhelming feeling was that I had wandered into a place where I didn't belong.
I hesitated, wondering if it was really alright to step on this carpet with shoes still wet from the snowy path.
#Benio
"I'll have a room prepared for you shortly. In the meantime, please make yourselves at home in the drawing room."
#Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
It was just as I offered my thanks.
#???
"Benio, are you back?"
A voice called out from above.
#Benio
"Ah, Sister. I've just returned."
Benio-san looked up toward the second floor.
Following her gaze, I saw a woman descending the staircase that led from the second floor.
#???
"I'm glad you made it back before the snow got any worse. And who are our guests?"
The woman looked at us and questioned Benio-san.
#Benio
"Yes, they seemed to have lost their way in this snow. They intended to head for the village, but given the weather, I invited them here."
#???
"I see... You must have had a difficult time."
#Protagonist
"Thanks to her, we're safe."
#???
"I am Ai, the eldest daughter of the Nanatsuki family."
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
#Benio
"Sister, let's not keep them standing. I'd like to show them to the drawing room."
#Ai
"Yes, of course. This way, please."
With that, Ai-san opened a door on the left.
Beyond the door, another hallway stretched out.
There were two doors on either side, and one large door at the very end.
Ai-san opened the door at the far left.
#Ai
"Please, come in."
#Protagonist
"Pardon me."
The room we were shown into appeared to be a drawing room.
A fire burned brightly in the fireplace set into the wall.
#Benio
"I shall go and prepare some hot tea."
Benio-san left the room.
#Ai
"Please, have a seat."
I sat down on the sofa as instructed.
#Ai
"There aren't any other houses in this area, so I'm truly glad you found us. The blizzard will only get worse from here on out."
#Protagonist
"Is that so?"
#Ai
"Yes. Every year at this time, without fail, a violent blizzard arrives that lasts for several days."
Hearing that, I looked toward the window.
Even though the sun should have set by now, it was a wall of white; I couldn't see a thing.
Occasionally, the glass would creak and rattle.
#Ai
"The local terrain likely plays a part, but some say it is the wrath of the mountain god."
#Souko
"The god's wrath?"
#Ai
"Yes... and some even call it a calamity brought upon the Nanatsuki family..."
#Benio
"Sister, you'll frighten our guests speaking like that."
Benio-san returned with a tray of cups.
#Benio
"Here, please have some tea."
#Protagonist
"Thank you."
I cupped the tea in both hands.
The warmth slowly seeped into my numb hands.
#Souko
"Is this blizzard part of the 'Nanatsuki Curse' as well?"
#Benio
"It may well be. After all, it is said that Father even mentioned the curse in his will."
#Ai
"Stop it, Benio!"
Ai-san scolded Benio-san with a sharp tone.
#Benio
"It was a joke, Sister."
Benio-san laughed, covering her mouth.
It didn't sound like a joke at all to me...
Souko-san must have felt the same; she was staring intently at Benio-san.
#Souko
"By 'Father,' do you mean Kousei Nanatsuki, who passed away recently?"
#Ai
"Yes. You are quite well-informed."
#Benio
"It seems they are researching the legends of the Nanatsuki family."
#Ai
"The legends... well..."
Ai-san placed a hand to her mouth, looking troubled.
#Ai
"Such matters aren't something to be spoken of lightly..."
#Protagonist
"Ah, no, I'm sorry for prying like that."
I apologized before Souko-san could cut in.
A quick glance told me that, as expected, Souko-san looked displeased.
I just didn't want to cause trouble for the people who had helped us...
The door to the hallway opened.
#Ai
"Ah... Mother."
Ai-san stood up and straightened her posture.
I instinctively started to stand as well, but the woman entering the room raised a hand slightly to stop me.
#???
"Please, stay as you are."
Her expression was gentle, yet she carried an unmistakable air of authority.
#???
"I am Maya Nanatsuki, the current head of this house. I heard you were stranded nearby. You must have had a harrowing ordeal."
#Protagonist
"No, it wasn't quite as dire as being 'stranded,' really."
Although we certainly came close.
#Maya
"I see. Please, do make yourselves comfortable here."
#Souko
"Please, don't trouble yourself. I apologize for intruding so soon after the passing of Kousei-shi."
For once, Souko-san gave a proper response and bowed her head.
When she acts like this, she really seems like a cool, reliable senior.
#Maya
"Oh? You were acquainted with my husband?"
#Souko
"I've only had the pleasure of listening to some of his musical compositions."
#Maya
"He would have been delighted to hear that."
Maya-san lightly dabbed at the corners of her eyes.
#Protagonist
"...Was he famous?"
#Souko
"In a way. He's the kind of artist where those in the know really appreciate his work, though a boy like you probably wouldn't listen to it."
I had assumed Souko-san just happened to pick up some trivia about him while looking into Nanatsuki Village.
#Ai
"...In recent years, he became quite unable to compose music, and because of that...!"
Ai-san bit her lip, cutting herself off.
#Souko
"And because of that?"
#Benio
"He committed suicide."
Benio-san finished the sentence nonchalantly.
#Ai
"Benio!"
Ai-san grabbed Benio-san's sleeve.
#Maya
"Let it be, Ai. It is simply the truth."
Maya-san reproved Ai-san with a gentle voice.
#Souko
"He took his own life?"
#Maya
"...Yes. My husband was stricken with illness and did not have long to live. One morning, when I went to his room, he was already..."
#Souko
"...I see. I'm sorry for asking."
#Maya
"Don't be. ...By the way, how long do the two of you intend to stay with us?"
#Protagonist
"Um... we plan to head out as soon as the blizzard lets up."
#Benio
"I don't think it will stop for a while yet."
Benio-san murmured while looking out the window.
#Maya
"Indeed. ...I'll have rooms prepared for you, so please feel free to stay as long as you like."
#Protagonist
"But... wouldn't we be a burden?"
Even if she told me 'as long as I liked,' it was a bit overwhelming.
#Maya
"Oh, I know. You both simply must attend the wedding ceremony."
#Protagonist
"Eh!? A-A wedding...?"
Being told that so out of the blue...
#Ai
"It's not a formal affair by any means. It's more of a small ritual held only among relatives."
#Protagonist
"But wouldn't it be an intrusion for us to be there?"
#Benio
"Not at all. ...If you wish to research this place, I believe it's something you really should see."
Benio-san whispered that into Souko-san's ear.
#Souko
"Does it have something to do with our research?"
Souko-san asked back with a dubious look.
#Benio
"Of course. It's a very unusual custom."
#Souko
"I see. ...In that case, would it be alright if we joined you? Ah, but our clothes are like this..."
It seemed even Souko-san thought it would be bad form to attend a ceremony in everyday clothes.
#Maya
"Hehe... I don't mind in the least."
#Protagonist
"Eh, are you sure?"
#Maya
"As long as you remain quiet during the ritual, there will be no problem."
#Souko
"I understand. Thank you for having us."
Souko-san bowed.
#Ai
"The wedding rite begins at midnight, so please relax until then."
#Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
#Maya
"Now then, I have preparations to attend to. Ai, Benio, please show our guests around the interior."
#Benio
"Understood, Mother."
With a graceful bow, Maya-san left the room.
#Protagonist
"She's a beautiful woman."
I whispered softly to Souko-san beside me.
#Souko
"Indeed. She looks so young, it's hard to believe she's the mother of these two... Oh, and whose wedding is it?"
Souko-san asked the two sisters.
#Ai
"Our youngest sister's."
#Benio
"We are three sisters, you see."
#Souko
"And where is she now?"
#Ai
"Since it's before the ceremony, she should be waiting in her room. We'll introduce you later if there's a chance."
#Benio
"Yes. But before that, we shall give you a tour of the mansion."
#Protagonist
"Ah, right. Thank you."
#Ai
"Should I or Benio show you around?"
Hmm... who should I ask?
Ask Ai
Ask Benio
#Protagonist
"Then, Ai-san, would you mind?"
#Ai
"Certainly, I don't mind at all."
#Benio
"I shall go and prepare for the ceremony. Until later, then."
Benio-san left the room.
#Ai
"Shall we go?"
Following Ai-san, we stood up from the sofa and left the drawing room.
#Protagonist
"In that case, Benio-san, if you please."
#Benio
"Understood."
Benio-san smiled.
#Ai
"Then, I'll take my leave for now. See you later."
Ai-san left the room.
#Benio
"Shall we be off as well?"
Guided by Benio-san, we departed from the drawing room.
