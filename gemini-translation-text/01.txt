********************
Having finished writing everything, he set down his brush.
This is enough—this will do.
Rather than wasting away from disease, he chose a death with pride.
$ Sitting shallowly in the chair, he let out a breath.
He was beyond exhausted.
His body felt heavy, like lead.
But even so, one final task remained.
He moved his failing body back to the bedroom and picked up the hemp rope he had prepared.
He tied loops on both ends, securing one side to the leg of the bed.
He opened the window.
The sky was choked with grey clouds.
$ He picked up a single snowdrop flower that had been resting in a vase.
In the end, he could find no hope for himself.
However, he could entrust that hope to those he was leaving behind.
$ He placed the rope around his neck and stood upon the window ledge.
Goodbye, my beloved daughters—
Hanging by the window, his body swayed in the wind.
He departed before the pain could even take hold.
Holding only that single snowdrop.
$ From the overcast sky, white flakes began to drift down.
The world was being filled with white snow.
It was as if an angel had come to take him home.

********************
The snow that had been falling since just after noon quickly buried the traces of the path left on the ground.
Looking back, only the intermittent trail of our own footprints remained.
There was no one behind me.
Far ahead of me walked Kirihara-senpai—Souko-san.
#Protagonist
"Wait up, Souko-san."
#Souko
"What is it~?"
#Protagonist
"I said wait! I'm carrying your bags too, you know!"
#Souko
"It can't be helped, can it? I *am* injured, after all."
Souko-san walked back toward me.
#Protagonist
"Calling it an injury is a bit much. You just bumped your hand against a tree when you slipped and fell."
#Souko
"It hurts, and if it hurts, it hurts! There's nothing to be done about it."
Souko-san clutched her right hand and groaned with exaggerated flair.
#Protagonist
"Even so, you only hit your pinky. Surely you can at least carry your own rucksack?"
#Souko
"Weren't you the one who said, 'Souko-san, if it's too difficult, shall I carry your luggage for you'?"
#Protagonist
"Well, yeah, I did say that, but..."
#Souko
"Then there's no problem, right?"
#Protagonist
"But Souko-san, your rucksack is insanely heavy! It’s way heavier than mine."
#Souko
"When a girl goes on a trip, she inevitably ends up with a lot of things to bring along."
#Protagonist
"Normal girls don't carry around this much bottled cola. Exactly how many are in here?"
#Souko
"I stocked up at the station at the foot of the mountain, so there should still be a dozen left, I think."
#Protagonist
"Give me a break..."
They'd been clinking and clanking noisily on my back for a while now.
#Souko
"Once we find a place to settle down, I'll drink some, so it should get a bit lighter."
#Protagonist
"Where on this snowy mountain do you expect us to 'settle down'?"
I looked up and scanned our surroundings.
A landscape of unbroken white.
On one side, a steep slope stretched endlessly upward.
As for the other side, a slope continued just as far down.
We were on a narrow path, less than a meter wide, where one slip would send you tumbling down.
#Protagonist
"Hey, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Hmm?"
#Protagonist
"Are you absolutely sure this is the right way?"
#Souko
"...Of course it is."
#Protagonist
"Why did you hesitate for a second?"
#Souko
"There's no way I'd make a mistake."
#Protagonist
"Well, I know you're famous at the university for being brilliant, so I'd like to think you wouldn't be wrong, but..."
#Souko
"The direction is correct. I'm certain that if we keep going straight this way, we'll reach Nanatsuki Village."
Souko-san pointed further down the path.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
#Souko
"What?"
#Protagonist
"Have you ever heard the saying 'haste makes waste'?"
#Souko
"Of course I have."
#Protagonist
"I wish you'd consider taking a path that's actually easy to walk on."
#Souko
"But I thought it was a shortcut."
#Protagonist
"Please don't try to act cute all of a sudden."
#Souko
"Yeah, that even felt a bit gross to me."
#Protagonist
"Good grief... where's the map?"
#Souko
"A map? I don't have one."
#Protagonist
"Huh?"
#Souko
"I memorized the terrain around here before we came. The river flowing through this valley we're walking in... if you follow it all the way down, it connects to the Kitakami River."
#Protagonist
"But we're heading upstream right now."
#Souko
"Exactly. And if you go upstream, you reach Nanatsuki Village."
#Protagonist
"I can trust you on that, right?"
#Souko
"Of course. If you really can't trust me, you're free to go home."
#Protagonist
"Don't be ridiculous."
#Souko
"It's a joke. I'd be in trouble if I lost my cola porter."
#Protagonist
"So I'm just a cola mule now?"
#Souko
"Well, you were the one who insisted on coming along for this investigation, weren't you?"
#Protagonist
"Well, yeah, that's true, but..."
It's no use.
I simply can't win against this woman.
It all started when she—Souko Kirihara, my senior in the folklore seminar—announced she wanted to research the unusual customs of the Tohoku region.
Souko-san's interest was piqued by legends remaining in mountain villages, distinct from the 'Tales of Tono' by Kunio Yanagita.
The settlement, known as 'Nanatsuki Village,' has reportedly been ruled for generations by the Nanatsuki clan since the middle of the Edo period.
Apparently, the first head of the family was a major Westernophile; he was devoted to foreign magic and occultism, smuggling various items into Japan while the country was still secluded.
Perhaps because of that, Western-style legends survived in Nanatsuki Village and have been passed down to this day.
Of course, I have no idea how much of it is actually true.
It's only natural for rumors to be embellished—or so Souko-san always says.
Some theories even claim there are Western occult books brought back in secret by the Keicho Embassy, which Date Masamune dispatched under Hasekura Tsunenaga.
It seems Souko-san wants to uncover the truth behind those stories during this investigation.
However...
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
#Souko
"What?"
#Protagonist
"Is it just me, or are we actually stranded out here?"
The wind and snow grew even more intense, until I could barely see a few meters ahead.
#Souko
"You're imagining things."
Souko-san, with snow even clinging to her eyebrows, looked away.
#Protagonist
"You really ought to do something about that haphazard personality of yours."
#Souko
"Oh, shut it. We're on a mountain in the snow; can't we just enjoy ourselves?"
#Protagonist
"This feels less like a hike and more like a forced march through the snow."
I tried to make a joke of it, but it might not have been a very funny one given the circumstances.
#Souko
"Admittedly, this is getting a bit rough."
Souko-san stopped at a level spot.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, is your hand okay?"
#Souko
"Mm, I still have some sensation in it, at least."
She breathed onto her gloved hands.
#Protagonist
"I wish we could find somewhere to get out of the wind."
It felt like even the inside of my nose was freezing over.
I eventually slipped the rucksack off my shoulders and set it on the snow.
#Souko
"Don't let the cola freeze. It'll taste awful."
#Protagonist
"Can we at least worry about ourselves for a change?"
#Souko
"My intuition tells me we should be reaching Nanatsuki Village soon... Hmm?"
#Protagonist
"Is something wrong?"
#Souko
"Did you hear something just now?"
#Protagonist
"Huh?"
At her words, I strained my ears to listen.
I heard nothing but the howling wind.
#Souko
"Was that an animal?"
I still couldn't hear a thing.
#Souko
"A horse... maybe?"
#Protagonist
"Out here?"
#Souko
"Oh, look. It's coming from over there."
Souko-san pointed behind me.
I turned my attention in that direction.
From beyond the swirling blizzard, I heard the faint, distant neighing of a horse.
#Protagonist
"It definitely is coming from that way... let's check it out."
We pushed through the heavy snow.
We emerged onto what looked like a road.
In the distance, a gray shadow appeared.
#Protagonist
"A carriage...?"
What I’d taken for gray was only because it was obscured by the blowing snow.
As it drew closer, I realized it was a carriage painted pitch black.
The horse was pure white, its nostrils huffing clouds of steam.
Between the stark colors and the mode of transport itself, it felt incredibly out of place.
With a soft whinny, the horse came to a halt in front of us.
The driver, reins in hand, looked down at us with a bewildered expression.
Well, anyone would be puzzled to find two people turned into human snowmen in the middle of these mountains.
#???
"Is something the matter?"
The voice came from inside the carriage.
A woman opened the window slightly, squinting against the biting wind as she looked at me.
#Protagonist
"Ah, well... we seem to have lost our way..."
#???
"Oh dear, that is quite a predicament."
With those words, the woman opened the carriage door.
The person who emerged was a young woman about the same age as me.
#???
"Where were you intending to go?"
#Protagonist
"A place called Nanatsuki Village, near here."
I answered, flustered by her refined demeanor.
#???
"Oh... whatever shall we do?"
She touched her hand to her lips and looked back in the direction the carriage had come from.
#???
"The center of the village is at least ten kilometers away from here."
#Protagonist
"Ten kilometers..."
Feeling a wave of dizziness, I glanced at Souko-san.
She looked away.
#???
"Do you have business in the village?"
#Protagonist
"Yes, well... we're students from a university in Tokyo, researching folklore."
#???
"Oh, so you're students?"
Though she was likely around our age, her old-fashioned way of speaking made her seem much older.
#Souko
"We're researching the legends of Nanatsuki Village."
Souko-san chimed in.
#???
"The village legends... In that case, I believe it would be better for you to come to my home rather than heading into the village proper."
#Protagonist
"To your... home?"
#???
"I've been remiss in introducing myself. I am Benio, the second daughter of the Nanatsuki family. It is a pleasure to meet you."
#Protagonist
"The Nanatsuki family...?"
#Souko
"The clan that has ruled Nanatsuki Village for generations."
#Benio
"Oh my... 'ruled' is such a strong word. We have simply lived on this land since ancient times."
Benio-san gave a light, melodic laugh.
I suppose that was what they call a refined upbringing.
#Souko
"But well, it might be for the best to accept your hospitality."
Souko-san shrugged, clutching both hands in front of her chest as she spoke.
I wondered if the hand she’d bumped earlier was still bothering her.
#Protagonist
"Is it really alright?"
#Benio
"Yes, I don't mind at all. The snow is supposed to get heavier, and you'll freeze if you stay out here."
With that, she beckoned us inside.
#Protagonist
"After you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Thank you."
Souko-san brushed the snow off her winter gear and climbed into the carriage first.
I handed both our bags to the driver, who had stepped down to help, and then I climbed into the carriage myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1700.txt
********************
The interior was incomparably warmer than the outside.
#Benio
"Please, do make yourselves comfortable."
As told, I took a seat opposite her, next to Souko-san.
The carriage swayed slightly as it began to move.
#Benio
"Are you two a couple?"
#Souko
"We're not."
Souko-san denied it without a moment's hesitation.
Well, that's only natural, but still.
#Souko
"He's just my assistant. Ah, I'm Souko Kirihara."
#Benio
"Kirihara-san. And you?"
#Protagonist
"I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Benio
"I see. And where did you walk from?"
#Protagonist
"From the station at the foot of the mountain."
#Benio
"My... if you were coming from there, it would have been much faster to take a bus from the city."
#Protagonist
"Is that so? I was told it was closer from the base."
Of course, the one who told me that was Souko-san, who was now sitting silently beside me.
#Benio
"Still, it's a wonder you made it this far. Summer is one thing, but people go missing in these mountains every winter."
#Souko
"See? My sense of direction wasn't wrong, was it?"
#Protagonist
"Don't 'see' me."
#Benio
"Hehe... the two of you are very lucky."
#Protagonist
"You think so?"
#Benio
"Yes. No one uses this path but us. Even then, only once every few days. I can only think of it as a stroke of incredible good fortune."
#Souko
"How much longer until we reach the mansion?"
#Benio
"Let's see..."
Benio-san cast her gaze out the window.
#Benio
"We're approaching a patch of snowdrops, so in this weather, perhaps another thirty minutes."
#Protagonist
"Snowdrops?"
#Benio
"Yes, they're also known as 'Matsuyukisou.' They bloom around February or March."
#Protagonist
"Huh..."
So there are flowers that bloom in this kind of season.
#Souko
"The language of flowers... hope and consolation, wasn't it?"
#Benio
"Yes, you're quite well-informed. ...But are you aware there's another, hidden meaning?"
#Protagonist
"A hidden meaning?"
#Benio
"In certain parts of England, they are apparently treated as a symbol of death."
#Protagonist
"Even though they also mean hope?"
#Benio
"Indeed. A flower that must never be given to another—for it carries the meaning of wishing for the recipient's death."
#Protagonist
"...That's a bit creepy."
#Souko
"It's not like the flower itself is poisonous, so it's fine."
Just as Souko-san said that, the carriage stopped swaying.
#Coachman
"Lady Benio, we have arrived."
The coachman's voice drifted in from outside, muffled by the wind.
#Benio
"I understand."
She gave a short reply and then turned back toward us.
#Benio
"From here, we must proceed on foot. Please bear with it for just a little longer."
#Protagonist
"Right."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1730.txt
********************
When we stepped out of the carriage, a bridge stood directly before us.
It was an old wooden suspension bridge that looked as if it might rot and collapse at any moment.
#Benio
"My home is just on the other side."
She spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
#Protagonist
"The other side, you say..."
The suspension bridge creaked and groaned as it swayed.
It wasn't exactly a sheer cliff, but if I slipped and fell, there was no way I'd survive.
#Benio
"The carriage cannot go any further than this, you see."
Benio-san checked the luggage the coachman had unloaded from the carriage.
#Benio
"Three days from now, then."
#Coachman
"Yes, ma'am. I'll be bringing the fuel then."
#Benio
"Right. If anything else is needed, I shall call. I'm counting on you."
#Coachman
"Understood, Lady Benio."
The coachman bowed and climbed back into the carriage.
#Souko
"She's quite something, isn't she?"
Souko-san whispered into my ear.
#Protagonist
"She definitely has the air of a high-born lady."
#Souko
"It’s like she was born knowing exactly how to command others."
#Protagonist
"Aren't you pretty much the same, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"I am most certainly not. Anyway, never mind that—go help her with her bags."
Souko-san poked me in the back, nudging me toward Benio-san.
#Protagonist
"Ah, Benio-san, would you like me to carry those for you?"
#Benio
"Oh no, I couldn't possibly ask a guest to do such a thing."
#Souko
"Please, don't hesitate to use him. His physical stamina is about the only thing he can be proud of."
#Protagonist
"That's not true at all."
#Benio
"Hehe... and yet, isn't he already carrying your luggage as well?"
#Souko
"It's light, so it's fine."
Actually, Souko-san, that cola of yours is incredibly heavy.
#Benio
"You really don't have to push yourself, you know?"
#Protagonist
"I don't think I'm overdoing it, but..."
With my rucksack and Souko-san's on my back, I took Benio-san's bags in both hands.
I could manage to walk, but crossing that suspension bridge like this was a little terrifying.
#Souko
"Were you out doing some shopping?"
#Benio
"Yes. Normally our maid handles it, but I had some errands of my own to attend to in the city."
#Souko
"It must be difficult, traveling from all the way out here."
#Benio
"Quite. In the summer, one can drive a car up this far, but once the snow piles up, that's no longer an option."
#Protagonist
"Can a carriage climb higher than a car?"
#Souko
"Horses are much better for snowy roads. A car would just slide all over the place."
#Benio
"Exactly. Shall we proceed, then?"
Benio-san began to walk.
I followed behind her, staggering slightly.
As we neared the suspension bridge, the sense of dread only intensified.
#Protagonist
"...It would be a disaster if someone fell, wouldn't it?"
#Souko
"Is there no other way in?"
#Benio
"There is none. If this bridge were to be destroyed, we would be completely isolated."
Benio-san gave a melodic little laugh.
#Protagonist
"I really don't think that's something to laugh about."
I carefully watched my step as I slowly made my way across the bridge.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
I called out to Souko-san behind me.
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Don't even think about pushing me from behind, even as a joke."
#Souko
"I won't. It would be a catastrophe if my cola fell."
I wish she’d worry about me just a little bit.
#Souko
"The wind is so strong..."
The snow was blowing almost horizontally.
#Benio
"Once we cross the bridge and pass through the woods, we'll be right there. Please bear with it for a moment longer."
#Protagonist
"I'm fine, but..."
I wondered if Souko-san's hand was alright.
Having finished crossing the suspension bridge, I let out a sigh of relief.
A line of trees stood ahead of us, with a narrow path winding between them.
I still couldn't see any buildings from here.
#Souko
"Is the place up ahead the 'Nanatsuki-kan'?"
#Benio
"That seems to be what it is called in the village."
#Protagonist
"Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"Apparently, it's not written with the character for 'moon,' but with the one for 'haunt' or 'possess.'"
#Benio
"The Nanatsuki family originally used that character, I am told. Though it was changed several generations ago because the name was considered quite unlucky."
#Protagonist
"Well, the moon in the sky is certainly much prettier."
#Benio
"Indeed it is."
Once we entered the woods, the wind and snow seemed to calm down somewhat.
#Benio
"Are you familiar with the appearance of the Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"I've heard stories. Something about it being built by an architect from abroad."
#Benio
"It was apparently built shortly after the start of the Meiji era. At the time, there were no other Western-style mansions of this scale in the Tohoku region."
Benio-san began her explanation as she walked slowly.
#Benio
"It is said that the head of the family at the time was so enamored with a building he saw overseas that he had a replica built here."
#Protagonist
"What does it look like?"
#Benio
"Well, it would be best for you to see it for yourselves."
Benio-san raised her arm and pointed ahead.
Through a break in the trees, something like a black mountain appeared.
It was a building whose outer walls were painted jet black.
Its overwhelming presence was such that one could never lose sight of it, no matter how the snow raged.
It looked like a void of darkness, as if a piece of the world had been hollowed out right there.
A large clock was mounted high above the entrance.
#Protagonist
"So this is the Nanatsuki-kan..."
#Benio
"It is quite unusual, is it not? Even now, many strange artifacts remain within."
#Souko
"I wonder if those are what gave rise to the legends."
#Benio
"Perhaps. If the opportunity arises, I shall tell you all about them."
Benio-san wore an indescribable smile.
#Benio
"But before that, we must see to your exhaustion. And it seems Kirihara-san is injured as well."
#Souko
"You noticed?"
Souko-san seemed a little surprised.
#Benio
"I noticed you were shielding your hand for some time now. Our family doctor is in residence here, so it would be best to have him examine it later."
#Souko
"I see. Thank you."
#Benio
"Now then, welcome... to the Nanatsuki-kan."
Benio-san gave a graceful bow, gesturing toward the jet-black mansion towering before us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1800.txt
********************
Brushing the accumulated snow off our winter gear, we stepped inside the Nanatsuki-kan.
The entrance hall was spacious, with a vaulted ceiling that reached up to the second floor.
While there was little in the way of gaudy decoration, the furniture placed subtly throughout was clearly of high quality.
Unlike the exterior, it gave off a very calm impression.
Perhaps it was due to the monochrome color scheme.
Even so, to a commoner like me, the overwhelming feeling was that I had wandered into a place where I didn't belong.
I hesitated, wondering if it was really alright to step on this carpet with shoes still wet from the snowy path.
#Benio
"I'll have a room prepared for you shortly. In the meantime, please make yourselves at home in the drawing room."
#Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
It was just as I offered my thanks.
#???
"Benio, are you back?"
A voice called out from above.
#Benio
"Ah, Sister. I've just returned."
Benio-san looked up toward the second floor.
Following her gaze, I saw a woman descending the staircase that led from the second floor.
#???
"I'm glad you made it back before the snow got any worse. And who are our guests?"
The woman looked at us and questioned Benio-san.
#Benio
"Yes, they seemed to have lost their way in this snow. They intended to head for the village, but given the weather, I invited them here."
#???
"I see... You must have had a difficult time."
#Protagonist
"Thanks to her, we're safe."
#???
"I am Ai, the eldest daughter of the Nanatsuki family."
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
#Benio
"Sister, let's not keep them standing. I'd like to show them to the drawing room."
#Ai
"Yes, of course. This way, please."
With that, Ai-san opened a door on the left.
Beyond the door, another hallway stretched out.
There were two doors on either side, and one large door at the very end.
Ai-san opened the door at the far left.
#Ai
"Please, come in."
#Protagonist
"Pardon me."
The room we were shown into appeared to be a drawing room.
A fire burned brightly in the fireplace set into the wall.
#Benio
"I shall go and prepare some hot tea."
Benio-san left the room.
#Ai
"Please, have a seat."
I sat down on the sofa as instructed.
#Ai
"There aren't any other houses in this area, so I'm truly glad you found us. The blizzard will only get worse from here on out."
#Protagonist
"Is that so?"
#Ai
"Yes. Every year at this time, without fail, a violent blizzard arrives that lasts for several days."
Hearing that, I looked toward the window.
Even though the sun should have set by now, it was a wall of white; I couldn't see a thing.
Occasionally, the glass would creak and rattle.
#Ai
"The local terrain likely plays a part, but some say it is the wrath of the mountain god."
#Souko
"The god's wrath?"
#Ai
"Yes... and some even call it a calamity brought upon the Nanatsuki family..."
#Benio
"Sister, you'll frighten our guests speaking like that."
Benio-san returned with a tray of cups.
#Benio
"Here, please have some tea."
#Protagonist
"Thank you."
I cupped the tea in both hands.
The warmth slowly seeped into my numb hands.
#Souko
"Is this blizzard part of the 'Nanatsuki Curse' as well?"
#Benio
"It may well be. After all, it is said that Father even mentioned the curse in his will."
#Ai
"Stop it, Benio!"
Ai-san scolded Benio-san with a sharp tone.
#Benio
"It was a joke, Sister."
Benio-san laughed, covering her mouth.
It didn't sound like a joke at all to me...
Souko-san must have felt the same; she was staring intently at Benio-san.
#Souko
"By 'Father,' do you mean Kousei Nanatsuki, who passed away recently?"
#Ai
"Yes. You are quite well-informed."
#Benio
"It seems they are researching the legends of the Nanatsuki family."
#Ai
"The legends... well..."
Ai-san placed a hand to her mouth, looking troubled.
#Ai
"Such matters aren't something to be spoken of lightly..."
#Protagonist
"Ah, no, I'm sorry for prying like that."
I apologized before Souko-san could cut in.
A quick glance told me that, as expected, Souko-san looked displeased.
I just didn't want to cause trouble for the people who had helped us...
The door to the hallway opened.
#Ai
"Ah... Mother."
Ai-san stood up and straightened her posture.
I instinctively started to stand as well, but the woman entering the room raised a hand slightly to stop me.
#???
"Please, stay as you are."
Her expression was gentle, yet she carried an unmistakable air of authority.
#???
"I am Maya Nanatsuki, the current head of this house. I heard you were stranded nearby. You must have had a harrowing ordeal."
#Protagonist
"No, it wasn't quite as dire as being 'stranded,' really."
Although we certainly came close.
#Maya
"I see. Please, do make yourselves comfortable here."
#Souko
"Please, don't trouble yourself. I apologize for intruding so soon after the passing of Kousei-shi."
For once, Souko-san gave a proper response and bowed her head.
When she acts like this, she really seems like a cool, reliable senior.
#Maya
"Oh? You were acquainted with my husband?"
#Souko
"I've only had the pleasure of listening to some of his musical compositions."
#Maya
"He would have been delighted to hear that."
Maya-san lightly dabbed at the corners of her eyes.
#Protagonist
"...Was he famous?"
#Souko
"In a way. He's the kind of artist where those in the know really appreciate his work, though a boy like you probably wouldn't listen to it."
I had assumed Souko-san just happened to pick up some trivia about him while looking into Nanatsuki Village.
#Ai
"...In recent years, he became quite unable to compose music, and because of that...!"
Ai-san bit her lip, cutting herself off.
#Souko
"And because of that?"
#Benio
"He committed suicide."
Benio-san finished the sentence nonchalantly.
#Ai
"Benio!"
Ai-san grabbed Benio-san's sleeve.
#Maya
"Let it be, Ai. It is simply the truth."
Maya-san reproved Ai-san with a gentle voice.
#Souko
"He took his own life?"
#Maya
"...Yes. My husband was stricken with illness and did not have long to live. One morning, when I went to his room, he was already..."
#Souko
"...I see. I'm sorry for asking."
#Maya
"Don't be. ...By the way, how long do the two of you intend to stay with us?"
#Protagonist
"Um... we plan to head out as soon as the blizzard lets up."
#Benio
"I don't think it will stop for a while yet."
Benio-san murmured while looking out the window.
#Maya
"Indeed. ...I'll have rooms prepared for you, so please feel free to stay as long as you like."
#Protagonist
"But... wouldn't we be a burden?"
Even if she told me 'as long as I liked,' it was a bit overwhelming.
#Maya
"Oh, I know. You both simply must attend the wedding ceremony."
#Protagonist
"Eh!? A-A wedding...?"
Being told that so out of the blue...
#Ai
"It's not a formal affair by any means. It's more of a small ritual held only among relatives."
#Protagonist
"But wouldn't it be an intrusion for us to be there?"
#Benio
"Not at all. ...If you wish to research this place, I believe it's something you really should see."
Benio-san whispered that into Souko-san's ear.
#Souko
"Does it have something to do with our research?"
Souko-san asked back with a dubious look.
#Benio
"Of course. It's a very unusual custom."
#Souko
"I see. ...In that case, would it be alright if we joined you? Ah, but our clothes are like this..."
It seemed even Souko-san thought it would be bad form to attend a ceremony in everyday clothes.
#Maya
"Hehe... I don't mind in the least."
#Protagonist
"Eh, are you sure?"
#Maya
"As long as you remain quiet during the ritual, there will be no problem."
#Souko
"I understand. Thank you for having us."
Souko-san bowed.
#Ai
"The wedding rite begins at midnight, so please relax until then."
#Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
#Maya
"Now then, I have preparations to attend to. Ai, Benio, please show our guests around the interior."
#Benio
"Understood, Mother."
With a graceful bow, Maya-san left the room.
#Protagonist
"She's a beautiful woman."
I whispered softly to Souko-san beside me.
#Souko
"Indeed. She looks so young, it's hard to believe she's the mother of these two... Oh, and whose wedding is it?"
Souko-san asked the two sisters.
#Ai
"Our youngest sister's."
#Benio
"We are three sisters, you see."
#Souko
"And where is she now?"
#Ai
"Since it's before the ceremony, she should be waiting in her room. We'll introduce you later if there's a chance."
#Benio
"Yes. But before that, we shall give you a tour of the mansion."
#Protagonist
"Ah, right. Thank you."
#Ai
"Should I or Benio show you around?"
Hmm... who should I ask?
Ask Ai
Ask Benio
#Protagonist
"Then, Ai-san, would you mind?"
#Ai
"Certainly, I don't mind at all."
#Benio
"I shall go and prepare for the ceremony. Until later, then."
Benio-san left the room.
#Ai
"Shall we go?"
Following Ai-san, we stood up from the sofa and left the drawing room.
#Protagonist
"In that case, Benio-san, if you please."
#Benio
"Understood."
Benio-san smiled.
#Ai
"Then, I'll take my leave for now. See you later."
Ai-san left the room.
#Benio
"Shall we be off as well?"
Guided by Benio-san, we departed from the drawing room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

********************
Ai-san stepped into the hallway and began explaining the rooms.
#Ai
"The room on the entrance side of the drawing room we were just in is used for storage. Across the hall from that is the telephone room, and next to it is the office."
She introduced each one, pointing them out as we went.
#Ai
"And the door at the end here leads to the Great Hall, which serves as a space for everyone to relax."
With that, she opened the door.
It was a far more spacious room than the drawing room from before.
Two men were chatting on a sofa in the center of the room.
Since a wedding was taking place, it was only natural that there would be other guests.
#Ai
"Honestly... Dr. Mikanagi, Isamu-san, you shouldn't be drinking before the ceremony. You'll make us a laughingstock in front of our guests."
Ai-san approached the two of them and spoke up.
#???
"A little drink like this isn't a problem at all."
#???
"Exactly, Ai. There’s precious little else to do for fun around here."
#Ai
"Goodness..."
Ai-san let out an exasperated sigh.
#???
"And who might these people be?"
#Ai
"They were lost in the mountains. Benio found them on her way back and brought them under our protection."
#Protagonist
"Thank you for having us. I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
#???
"I am Hiroshi Mikanagi, the family's attending physician. A pleasure."
After bowing politely, he reached out to shake Souko-san's hand.
#Souko
"...Are you a doctor?"
#Mikanagi
"My father was the physician here as well, and I succeeded him. ...Oh, did something happen to your little finger?"
He seemed to have noticed Souko-san shielding her finger.
#Souko
"I bumped it while walking outside. Could I have a compress or something for it later?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, of course. It wouldn't do if there were something wrong with the bone; shall I examine it for you?"
#Souko
"No, that won't be necessary."
#???
"Hiroshi, hitting on a lady the moment you meet her is in poor taste. You're making the young man next to her uncomfortable."
#Mikanagi
"Haha, my apologies. I certainly didn't mean it that way."
#Souko
"And you are...?"
#???
"Me? I'm Isamu Rokuyou. I'm the groom who'll be holding the ceremony here today."
#Souko
"You are... I see. Congratulations."
#Rokuyou
"Thank you very much for your kind words."
#Mikanagi
"Still, I was surprised to hear Isamu was finally settling down. Have you finished cleaning up your 'loose ends' yet?"
#Protagonist
"Loose ends?"
#Mikanagi
"He’s been quite the playboy, you see. There are many things he needs to sort out."
#Rokuyou
"Don't go spreading such nasty rumors, Hiroshi. I haven't played around half as much as you have."
#Mikanagi
"Listen to him. Even though you were kicked out onto the street in nothing but your underwear back in Sendai."
#Rokuyou
"That's hardly a story to tell right now, is it!?"
Rokuyou-san poked Dr. Mikanagi, though he didn't seem truly angry.
#Ai
"You two, you're baffling our guests."
Ai-san scolded the laughing pair.
#Rokuyou
"It’s Hiroshi’s fault. Come on, what was your record? How many were you dating at once?"
#Mikanagi
"And here I thought I was always sincerely in love."
Dr. Mikanagi turned toward me with a chuckle.
#Mikanagi
"You’ve got it good, being here with such a beautiful girlfriend."
#Protagonist
"It's nothing like that."
#Souko
"I wonder why people always jump to those conclusions whenever a man and woman are together."
Souko-san muttered, sounding exasperated.
Well, it was certainly true we weren't lovers.
Our relationship would likely never develop into anything like that. Souko-san and I were far too poorly matched.
#Rokuyou
"Are you two students?"
Rokuyou-san asked, looking at me.
#Protagonist
"Yes. We attend a university in Tokyo. Souko-san—she's my senior in the folklore studies seminar."
#Rokuyou
"Folklore, huh... By any chance, did you come here to research this place?"
#Protagonist
"Well... it's more about the legends of Nanatsuki Village."
#Rokuyou
"It’s one and the same. Almost all the legends of Nanatsuki Village originate from the Nanatsuki family."
#Protagonist
"I heard their ancestors were quite infatuated with Western culture."
#Rokuyou
"So it seems. Though most of it is nothing more than rumors. Countrysides are always full of stories like that."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Rokuyou
"I've heard all sorts of stories since I started heading out to sea on ships, but I haven't found many places stranger than this."
#Protagonist
"Ships...?"
This place is way up in the mountains, though...
#Rokuyou
"My family are distant relatives of the Nanatsukis; we run a trading business in Ishinomaki, Miyagi. It's a small company, though, so I go out on the ships myself."
#Protagonist
"Hoh..."
He didn't look like a man of the sea, but perhaps that was because it was a merchant vessel.
#Rokuyou
"Of course, I haven't been on a ship lately since I've been staying here for quite some time."
With that, Rokuyou-san gave a light smile.
#Rokuyou
"On windy days like this, I'm glad I'm not out at sea."
It was true; the windows were rattling from the powerful wind.
The snow seemed to have picked up considerably as well.
#Rokuyou
"...Ah, that's right. About that book Ai asked for before—apparently my employees found it in San Francisco, so I'll bring it over next time."
#Ai
"Oh, really? I'll be looking forward to it."
Ai-san spoke with a look of joy.
#Protagonist
"Are you fond of books?"
#Ai
"Yes. It's difficult to acquire a decent selection of books around here."
I read a fair amount myself, but I'd never even thought about trying to get my hands on foreign books...
#Ai
"Isamu-san, I really must introduce our guests to the others, so we'll be taking our leave now."
#Rokuyou
"Right, I understand. Maybe you should tell Hiroshi instead of me."
Rokuyou-san pointed toward Dr. Mikanagi and Souko-san.
Dr. Mikanagi was chatting happily with Souko-san.
#Ai
"Goodness... Dr. Mikanagi."
#Mikanagi
"Ah, sorry. I got carried away talking."
#Souko
"No, please don't apologize. It was a pleasure."
Souko-san took a step back and bowed her head.
#Ai
"Well then, I'll show you the rest of the house."
#Mikanagi
"See you later."
#Protagonist
"Excuse us, then."
I bowed as well and followed her out of the Great Hall.
#Ai
"I'm sorry about that. Dr. Mikanagi is simply that way."
The moment we stepped into the hallway, Ai-san apologized to Souko-san.
#Souko
"Oh, please don't worry about it."
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, did you have him look at your hand?"
#Souko
"Just a light palpation. He said there's a chance it's broken, so I shouldn't move it much."
#Protagonist
"Are you going to be okay?"
#Souko
"It's not a problem for going about my daily business."
Souko-san replied while wiggling her fingers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1830a.txt
********************
We stepped through the door and returned to the entrance hall.
#Ai
"This area serves as the hall and entrance. These stairs are the only way to get to the second floor."
#Protagonist
"It really is spacious..."
I voiced my immediate impression.
#Ai
"Hehe... Indeed. At this time of year, all the warm air escapes to the second floor, so it's not a very pleasant place to linger."
With that, Ai-san opened the door on the opposite side from where we just came—the right side as seen from the entrance.
#Ai
"This wing contains the servants' quarters and the dining hall. The two doors on the right are the servants' rooms, on the left is the restroom, then the kitchen, and at the end is the great dining hall."
Ai-san explained each one as we walked along.
#Ai
"I'll introduce them to you later, but we have two servants on staff, so please let them know if you need anything at all."
#Protagonist
"Y-Yes..."
I'd never lived a life with servants before, so I wasn't quite sure how I was supposed to act.
Just then, a woman emerged from the kitchen entrance, carrying a stack of plates.
#Ai
"Ah, Akane-san."
#???
"Yes?"
The moment the woman turned around at the sound of her name, the plates she was holding came crashing down with a loud clatter.
#???
"A-Ah...!"
The woman stumbled as well.
#Protagonist
"Watch out!"
Save the girl
Catch the plates
I instinctively reached out and caught the woman just as she was about to fall.
#???
"Kyaa!"
#Protagonist
"A-Are you alright?"
I managed to support her weight, but...
...Um.
W-What should I do...
They're surprisingly b— No, that's not it.
#Protagonist
"D-Did you hit yourself anywhere...?"
I asked while still holding her.
#???
"Eh... T-Thank you... very much."
The woman called Akane-san blushed crimson, murmured her thanks, and pulled away from me.
#Ai
"...Akane-san."
Ai-san let out an exasperated sigh.
#???
"U-Um, I'm so sorry..."
#Ai
"...Instead of me, please apologize to our guests."
Souko-san, who had been standing next to Ai-san... was now cradling a massive stack of plates in both hands.
#???
"Aaah!? I-I'm so sorry!!"
#Protagonist
"A-Are you alright, Souko-san?"
I let go of Akane-san, rushed over to Souko-san, and took the plates from her.
#Souko
"...Well, it's fine."
I suppose I should praise her for not letting a single one hit the floor.
#Souko
"...I already know you're fond of girls."
#Protagonist
"T-That's a misunderstanding!"
#Souko
"So you hate them?"
#Protagonist
"Why would you even say that..."
I instinctively reached out for the plates that were flying through the air.
#???
"Kyaa!"
The woman tumbled onto the floor.
#???
"Oww..."
#Ai
"Akane-san... Are you alright?"
#???
"Y-Yes... My deepest apologies..."
Ai-san lent a hand, and the woman called Akane-san picked herself up.
#???
"U-Um... I'm sorry for the trouble."
#Protagonist
"I-It's fine."
I nodded while still cradling the massive stack of plates I'd saved at the last second.
#Ai
"I am so sorry. Our servant has been quite clumsy."
Ai-san bowed her head.
#???
"Um, I'm very sorry. I am Akane Hiyama, a maid of this house."
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara. Nice to meet you."
#Akane
"Um, I'm truly, truly sorry!"
Having her bow so low made me feel quite awkward myself.
#Protagonist
"No, please don't worry about it."
#Souko
"You certainly got your little perk out of it."
#Protagonist
"It wasn't like that."
#???
"What's all the racket?"
Another woman popped her head out of the kitchen.
#Akane
"I-It's nothing, Narumi-san."
Akane-san rushed over to her.
#Ai
"Good timing. Narumi-san, these people are our new guests."
#???
"I see."
#Protagonist
"Um, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
#???
"I'm Narumi Minakami. Nice to meet ya."
Once the greetings were over, Ai-san spoke to Narumi-san.
#Ai
"Now then, please prepare some extra food for dinner."
#Narumi
"Eeeh? Starting now?"
Narumi-san let out a blatantly reluctant groan.
#Ai
"We should have plenty of ingredients, right?"
#Narumi
"Yeah, well, we do... but it's such a pain."
...Was it really okay to say something like that to her employer?
#Ai
"I'm asking you anyway."
...Since Ai-san didn't seem to mind, maybe this was just a normal occurrence here.
#Narumi
"Fine, fine. So, do our guests have any food allergies or anything they can't eat?"
#Souko
"I don't have anything in particular."
#Protagonist
"I..."
I have none
Only Aspidistra leaves are no-go
#Protagonist
"I don't have anything I can't eat."
#Narumi
"Got it. Then shaved ice should be fine, right? We'll just use the snow from outside."
Narumi-san said something outrageous with a straight face.
#Akane
"Narumi-san!"
#Narumi
"I'm just kidding."
#Protagonist
"I just can't stand Aspidistra leaves."
#Narumi
"I see. Then I'll be sure to put lots in. ...Wait, what even is a 'Haran'?"
#Protagonist
"It's that green leaf decoration they put in sushi boxes."
#Narumi
"Ah, right. ...Wait, that's not even food, is it!?"
#Protagonist
"That's why I said I can't eat it."
#Narumi
"Wow, you're kind of annoying..."
#Akane
"Narumi-san, please calm down."
#Souko
"Seriously, now isn't the time to be teasing people."
Souko-san gave me a light flick to the head.
#Ai
"Narumi-san prepares all the meals for this house."
#Protagonist
"Hoh, so she's not exactly a chef?"
#Narumi
"Nothing that fancy. I just do it because I don't have any other skills."
#Ai
"You should follow Akane-san's example a little and learn how to do other household chores."
#Narumi
"Ye~s."
...That was a very half-hearted response.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1840a.txt
********************
#Souko
"They certainly are a lively bunch."
Souko-san spoke up once we returned to the hall.
#Ai
"Even so, they are both quite talented. Now then, this way next."
Ai-san opened the door in front of us with a smile.
Beyond the door lay a hallway similar to the ones we had seen before.
#Ai
"The guest rooms and the chapel are located on the north side. The door at the very end is the chapel, where the wedding ceremony is scheduled for tonight."
#Protagonist
"You even have a chapel?"
#Ai
"Yes. I’m told the heads of the family have been Christians for generations."
#Souko
"Are our rooms here as well?"
#Ai
"No, most of these are currently occupied. ...Oh, that's right, I must introduce you to Takamine-san as well."
Ai-san gave the first door on the right a light knock.
#Ai
"Takamine-san, are you in?"
After a short silence following Ai-san's call, the door opened with a creak.
#???
"...Do you need something?"
A large man with a prominent scar on his face appeared.
He was the type of person I would absolutely avoid making eye contact with if I saw him in the city.
...In fact, I still couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye.
#Ai
"These are our new guests. Since they will be staying the night, I thought I should introduce them to you."
#???
"I see."
#Souko
"I am Souko Kirihara. I apologize for the intrusion, but we will be staying under your roof tonight."
As expected of Souko-san, she remained unfazed even in the presence of such a fearsome-looking man.
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#???
"I am Jin Takamine, the family's legal counsel. A pleasure."
#Protagonist
"You're a lawyer?"
#Takamine
"...Is there a problem?"
His chilling glare pinned me in place, sending a shiver down my spine.
#Protagonist
"N-No, it's nothing..."
#Takamine
"Hmph... Is that all you came for?"
#Ai
"Yes, for now."
#Takamine
"...I see. Until later, then."
The door shut with a thud.
#Protagonist
"Phew..."
#Souko
"He's quite intimidating."
Souko-san voiced exactly what I was feeling.
#Ai
"He's a bit blunt, but he isn't a bad person. Takamine-san's father was also the family's lawyer."
#Souko
"The scar on his face... it looked like a burn."
#Ai
"Yes, I believe he suffered it long ago, but I don't know the details."
Ai-san shook her head.
#Ai
"Now then... across from Takamine-san's room is Isamu-san's—Rokuyou-san's room. Next to that is Tsujimura-san, who manages the manor."
#Souko
"You have a manager?"
#Ai
"Oh, yes... Tsujimura-san is my uncle. He used to be a painter, but now he acts as a sort of butler for us."
Ai-san knocked on the door a few times.
#Ai
"Tsujimura-san, our guests are here."
She stepped back and waited for a moment, but there was no sign of anyone coming out.
#Protagonist
"Is he not in?"
#Ai
"I wonder if he's in the office..."
#???
"Lady Ai, did you require something?"
I turned around at the sound of a voice from behind.
A middle-aged man was looking our way, having opened the large door in front of us.
#Ai
"Tsujimura-san, were you in the chapel?"
#???
"Yes, I was making preparations for tonight. ...Are these the people who were stranded?"
The man addressed as Tsujimura-san closed the large door and walked over to us.
#???
"I am Seiji Tsujimura, the manager of this manor."
#Protagonist
"I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
#Souko
"My name is Souko Kirihara. Um, Tsujimura-san, are you the Madam's brother?"
#Tsujimura
"No, I am the younger brother of the previous head. I used to paint, but I simply couldn't make a living at it... So I've been under the care of this household, much to my embarrassment."
Tsujimura-san bowed deeply as he spoke.
#Ai
"I happen to like your paintings, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Oh no, you shouldn't say such kind things..."
Tsujimura-san seemed to shrink away in humble embarrassment.
#Tsujimura
"I still have preparations to attend to, so if you'll excuse me."
Bowing deeply once more, Tsujimura-san disappeared back inside the large doors.
#Protagonist
"He seems like a kind man."
#Ai
"Yes... He could have potentially succeeded the Nanatsuki family headship, but he apparently had no interest in doing so."
#Souko
"Was he not mentioned in Kousei-shi's will?"
#Ai
"That... My apologies, but I'm not well-informed on that matter."
Ai-san spoke evasively.
Well, it would be problematic to discuss the contents of a will with outsiders like us, so it couldn't be helped.
#Ai
"Now then, I'll show you to the second floor next."
We returned to the hall and began climbing the stairs.
Looking down from above, the hall seemed even more cavernous than before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1850a.txt
********************
#Ai
"The west wing consists of the family's private rooms. Mother is at the far end, I'm at the back left, and Benio's room is right next to mine."
With that brief explanation, Ai-san turned on her heel.
Well, there wasn't anyone there right now, so I suppose there was no need to linger.
We circled back around, looking down over the hall, and entered the corridor on the opposite side.
#Ai
"At the end of this hallway is the music room. There are also rooms for instrument storage and sheet music."
#Souko
"Was it used by Kousei-shi?"
#Ai
"Yes. Though Benio has been using it quite often lately as well. There's nothing particularly valuable inside, so please feel free to use it if you like."
#Protagonist
"I'm afraid I don't know the first thing about playing an instrument."
#Souko
"You could always just sit there and clack some castanets."
Souko-san teased me as I scratched my head.
#Ai
"Hehe... I'll have the empty room on the front right prepared for you, Kirihara-san."
#Souko
"Thank you."
#Ai
"That leaves the north wing. There's another vacancy there, so I'll prepare that room for you."
#Protagonist
"I'm sorry for all the trouble we're causing."
#Ai
"It's no trouble at all. This is the first time such an unexpected thing has happened, but it's actually quite fun."
With a smile, Ai-san led us into the northern corridor.
#Ai
"The room at the very end here was my father's. Mikanagi-sensei is in the back left, and the study is directly across from him. The room next to that is the infirmary."
#Protagonist
"So, will I be staying in this room?"
I asked, pointing to the room next to Mikanagi-sensei's.
#Ai
"Yes, that's the one. Now, do you have any other questions?"
Souko-san raised her hand in response to Ai-san's question.
#Souko
"Would you mind if I took a look at Kousei-san's room?"
#Ai
"About that... We haven't opened it since my father passed away, so I'm afraid I must decline. I'm sorry."
#Protagonist
"A sealed room...?"
#Ai
"...I suppose you could call it that."
#Souko
"And one more thing—where are the baths?"
#Ai
"There's a bathroom in every room, so don't you worry. We pump water from underground, so you can have a hot bath whenever you like."
#Souko
"You really have thought of everything."
#Ai
"If you're feeling cold, please feel free to use it as soon as I've shown you to your room."
#Souko
"Yes, thank you."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1900.txt
********************
We returned to the drawing room and were left alone together.
#Souko
"This mansion really is quite spectacular, isn't it?"
#Protagonist
"So you think so too, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"Well, I've never had any connection to this kind of lifestyle. It almost makes me wonder if we're even still in Japan."
#Protagonist
"At least they speak the language here."
#Souko
"Even people in Hawaii speak Japanese these days. That's not what I meant. It's the atmosphere... the air itself feels different."
#Protagonist
"It certainly feels detached from the rest of the world... but what do you expect? We're deep in the mountains."
I turned my eyes toward the window.
The wind-whipped snow howled, completely obscuring the view outside.
The gale seemed even fiercer now than when we first arrived.
#Souko
"It has such a turn-of-the-century feel. You could call it 'Taisho Roman' and it wouldn't feel out of place at all."
#Protagonist
"Technically the Taisho era was in this century."
#Souko
"You really do love splitting hairs, don't you?"
Souko-san spoke with a look of exasperation, then suddenly slid her knees right up against mine.
#Protagonist
"What is it...?"
I felt my heart race as Souko-san leaned in close, her presence suddenly overwhelming.
#Souko
"You haven't forgotten why we're here, have you?"
#Protagonist
"Eh? ...Oh, right. We're here to investigate the legends of Nanatsuki Village."
I kept quiet about the fact that I'd nearly forgotten for a moment.
#Souko
"Exactly. There's no doubt that most of the folklore in Nanatsuki Village originates from this house. That's why I think we'll find all sorts of things if we look around."
#Protagonist
"Look around... as in, search the house?"
#Souko
"Not just that, we can interview people too. Like that lawyer."
#Protagonist
"Ehh?! But that guy seems terrifying."
#Souko
"If his family has been indebted to this house since his father's time, he's bound to know a lot."
#Protagonist
"If you're going by that logic, even the doctor—"
The sound of a knock made me swallow the rest of my sentence.
#Akane
"Excuse me. Your rooms are ready, so I've come to show you the way... Oh, is something wrong?"
#Souko
"No, nothing at all."
Souko-san pulled away from me.
#Akane
"I... I see. Well then, this way, please."
For some reason, Akane-san's cheeks were tinged with a deep blush.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
01_1910.txt
********************
I stepped out into the hallway, carrying both Souko-san’s luggage and my own.
#Akane
"Um... shall I help you with your bags?"
#Souko
"It's fine, we can handle this much."
I wasn't sure why Souko-san was the one answering for me.
Well, I’d been acting as her porter all the way through the mountains, so I guess it didn't matter.
#Akane
"Let's see... Kirihara-sama's room is on the east side of the second floor. May I show you there first?"
#Souko
"Yes, please."
We climbed the stairs to the eastern wing of the second floor.
Akane-san opened the door immediately to our right.
#Akane
"This is Kirihara-sama's room. Please, make yourself at home."
#Souko
"Right, thank you. I'll see you later then."
Souko-san took her bags from me and closed the door.
#Akane
"This way for the next room, please. It's in the north wing."
Once we reached the north side, Akane-san opened the door on the front left.
#Akane
"After you."
#Protagonist
"Excuse me."
I stepped inside and stood there, momentarily speechless.
I knew it would be spacious.
I knew it would look expensive.
But seeing it with my own eyes made me realize just how easily a person can be struck dumb with awe.
#Akane
"You are free to use anything in the room. The bath is here, and the towels are kept here as well... Is something the matter?"
#Protagonist
"Oh, no... I was just thinking that this has all turned into something incredible."
#Akane
"Hehe... I felt the same way when I first started working here. Even now, I get incredibly nervous just carrying the dinner plates."
#Protagonist
"Y-Yeah, I can imagine."
#Akane
"Dinner is at eight o'clock, so please come down to the grand dining hall on the first floor when it's time."
#Protagonist
"Got it."
#Akane
"If you'll excuse me, then."
Akane-san gave a polite bow and left the room.
#Protagonist
"Phew..."
I let out a deep sigh and looked up at the ceiling.
It was absurdly high.
Back at my apartment near the university, I can touch the ceiling without even standing on my tiptoes.
The bed was also obscenely large.
My entire room could probably fit right on top of it.
#Protagonist
"I'll never be able to relax in here..."
The sheets were pulled so taut without a single wrinkle that I felt guilty even thinking about sitting down and messing them up.
Part of me wondered if I should just sit in the corner of the room with my knees pulled to my chest.
I didn't actually do it, though, since that would just make me feel pathetic.
Instead, I took a seat in front of the fireplace.
The charcoal was glowing a deep, vibrant red.
Every so often, it would let out a sharp pop.
It was nice and warm, but I wondered what I was supposed to do with it when I went to sleep.
I'd have to ask someone later.
I stood up and turned around.
#Protagonist
"Oh, right."
I pulled my notebook out of my bag.
Most of the pages were still blank, but it might come in handy, so I decided to keep it on me.
For now, I started jotting down notes about the people staying here in Nanatsukikan.
#Protagonist
"There, that's done."
I set my pencil down and happened to glance at the window.
I couldn't see a thing outside.
I walked over to the window and pressed my finger against the glass.
The blizzard was still raging out there.
My fingertip gradually grew cold.
#Protagonist
"Hm...?"
Amidst the chaotic blur of black and white outside, I thought I saw something else.
I pressed my forehead against the pane and stared intently into the dark.
#Protagonist
"A light...?"
Not far off, I saw a flicker of light.
It was to the right of the window—the northwest direction.
This mansion is cross-shaped, and Benio-san’s family wing is to the southwest of this room, so seeing a light in the opposite direction was definitely strange.
Was there something out there?
The wind died down for just a moment.
#Protagonist
"A tower...?"
A tall, narrow silhouette loomed out of the darkness.
Illuminated by the surrounding snow, it gave off an indescribably eerie vibe.
Why was something like that even there?
And even stranger, a light was burning inside it.
The phrase "The Curse of the Seven Possessions" flickered through my mind.
No... that's impossible.
The wind picked up again, and the swirling snow once more hid the world from view.
I moved away from the window and collapsed onto the bed.
It was soft and warm.
Without worrying about the wrinkles I was making in the sheets, I closed my eyes.
#???
"...Hey, wake up. It's time... Hurry..."
...I could hear a gentle voice calling to me.
Yeah, I must be dreaming.
I knew I probably had to get up soon, but the warmth of the blankets was just too comfortable.
My body was exhausted, and even the effort to open my eyelids felt like too much.
#Protagonist
"Ngh... just five more minutes..."
#???
"Wake up, you moron."
#Protagonist
"Ow! Hey, don't hit me on the head..."
#Souko
"It's your fault for not waking up."
Souko-san stood over me, looking down with an air of superiority.
A bandage was wrapped around the pinky finger of her right hand.
It seemed she’d already had Mikanagi-sensei treat her injury.
#Protagonist
"I couldn't help it. I was tired."
I sat up and voiced my complaint.
#Souko
"You were told to be at the dining hall by eight, weren't you?"
#Protagonist
"Still, I think there are much nicer ways to wake someone up."
I rubbed the spot where she'd hit me.
#Souko
"And just how was I supposed to wake you up?"
#Protagonist
"Well, like at first. A gentle wake-up call would have been much better."
#Souko
"Hmm... is that so?"
A mischievous, wicked grin spread across Souko-san’s face.
#Protagonist
"Wait, So... Souko-san?"
#Souko
"...If that's what you desire... then I suppose I can oblige... Darling?"
A chill ran straight down my spine.
#Souko
"Darling, you need to wake up right now~. If you don't wake up, I'm going to pounce on you~!"
#Protagonist
"Whoa, Souko-san?! Why are you climbing into the covers with me?!"
I frantically tried to hold the blankets down over her.
#Souko
"Come on now~. In that case, you'd better get up quickly, right~?"
#Protagonist
"No, I'm getting up! I'm getting up!"
Unable to take it anymore, I practically rolled off the bed to escape her.
#Protagonist
"See? I'm awake!"
#Souko
"What's with that reaction? Are you really so unhappy about me pouncing on you?"
I'm not unhappy about it.
I am unhappy about it.
Please, just calm down.
#Protagonist
"No, it's not that I'm unhappy, but look, we're running out of time, right?"
#Souko
"Well, I guess that's true."
Souko-san still seemed a bit miffed.
#Souko
"Well, let's stop fooling around and go. It's time."
Souko-san grabbed my arm and started pulling me toward the hallway.
#Protagonist
"To be honest, I'm quite unhappy about it."
...She punched me with all her might.
#Souko
"Stop being an idiot and let's go. We're out of time."
Souko-san dragged me out of the room by my arm.
#Protagonist
"Calm down, Souko-san."
#Souko
"...When you dodge the subject like that, it makes me feel like a complete fool."
#Protagonist
"It's time, right? Come on, let's go."
Taking the hand of a still-pouting Souko-san, I led her out of the room.
#Souko
"Oh, can you hold this?"
Out in the hallway, Souko-san handed me a bottle of Cola.
#Protagonist
"Why are you bringing that with you?"
#Souko
"Because I'm going to want some during dinner, obviously."
#Protagonist
"...I don't think sweet drinks go well with a formal meal."
#Souko
"That's not true at all. I could eat rice with it—not ochazuke, maybe call it 'colazuke'."
#Protagonist
"...That's embarrassing, so please, absolutely do not do that."
...I'd better keep a tight grip on that Cola until after dinner is over.

********************
We proceeded down the eastern corridor of the first floor and arrived at the grand dining hall.
#Akane
"I've been expecting you. Please, take your seats here."
Guided by Akane-san, who had come to meet us, we were shown to our table.
It was an incredibly long, narrow table.
The kind you often see in foreign films... I never imagined I’d actually be sitting at one.
#Souko
"Don't just stand there daydreaming. Sit down."
Souko-san poked me in the side.
#Protagonist
"...Right. It's just a bit intimidating, honestly."
#Souko
"Don't you dare start saying you can't relax unless you're at a low table on tatami mats. It's embarrassing."
Souko-san promptly lowered herself into a chair.
A moment later, I sat down as well.
It seemed everyone we had met in the mansion so far was already gathered.
#Akane
"Would you like something to drink?"
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'll have—"
#Souko
"Cola, please."
Interrupting me, Souko-san ordered exactly what I expected.
#Akane
"C-Cola... is it?"
Akane-san tilted her head in confusion.
#Souko
"Yep. Do you have any?"
#Akane
"U-Um..."
Looking troubled, Akane-san turned her gaze toward me.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, don't be unreasonable. You should have just brought your own from the room."
There was no way a house like this would have Cola in stock.
#Souko
"Hmph..."
Souko-san began to pout.
#Akane
"U-Um, shall I go and fetch it for you?"
Unable to bear the awkwardness, Akane-san offered to go.
#Souko
"It's fine. I can endure it for a little while."
#Akane
"I-I see..."
I was worried Akane-san would walk away thinking Cola was some kind of incredibly rare or precious nectar.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, do you want the one I brought?"
I held out the bottle of Cola she had handed me outside the room earlier.
#Souko
"Oh, right. I knew it was a good idea to bring it along."
A bright smile spread across her face as she took the bottle.
#Akane
"So that is the drink called 'Cola'...?"
#Souko
"Exactly. Want a sip?"
#Akane
"Oh, I am still on duty... so, perhaps just a little bit later..."
She definitely seemed curious.
But I had to admire her for prioritizing her work like that.
I just hope the carbonation doesn't startle her.
#Rokuyou
"Cola, huh? I’m quite fond of it myself. I drank it often when I traveled to the States."
Rokuyou-san, sitting across from us, joined the conversation.
#Souko
"Right? Is the flavor different from the stuff overseas?"
Souko-san bit immediately.
#Rokuyou
"It's the same here as it is there—Cola is made by many different companies. But the top-selling brand tastes pretty much the same everywhere."
#Souko
"Hoh... I see, I see..."
Souko-san nodded along, looking deeply impressed.
#Rokuyou
"Well, I don't personally handle the imports, so I don't know all the fine details."
With that, Rokuyou-san laughed.
#Souko
"By the way, we haven't seen the bride yet."
#Protagonist
"Now that you mention it... she was the youngest sister, right?"
#Rokuyou
"You mean Shion? Maya-san, how is Shion doing?"
Rokuyou-san called out to Maya-san.
#Maya
"Shion is not feeling particularly well, so she is resting in her room until the ritual begins."
#Rokuyou
"I see."
#Protagonist
"Her name is Shion-san?"
#Rokuyou
"Yes. She’s never been very physically strong, but she is a lovely girl."
#Souko
"Are you marrying into the family as a groom-in-residence?"
#Rokuyou
"No, I remain a member of the Rokuyou family. The Nanatsukis are a matrilineal line, so I expect they'll eventually take a proper husband-in-residence for the estate."
#Souko
"Well, if it’s about the succession, that would fall to the eldest daughter, Ai-san, wouldn't it?"
I stole a glance at Ai-san.
She was quietly bringing food to her mouth.
Perhaps sensing my gaze, she looked over at me for a fleeting second and tilted her head curiously.
#Mikanagi
"I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Isamu was marrying Shion-san."
Dr. Mikanagi, sitting next to Rokuyou-san, joined the talk as well.
#Souko
"Oh? And why is that?"
#Mikanagi
"Because I was certain he and Ai-san would end up together."
#Rokuyou
"Give it a rest, Doctor. Sure, she and I are old childhood friends, but it's nothing like that."
Rokuyou-san said with a laugh.
#Protagonist
"Were the two of you close?"
#Rokuyou
"Well... we shared a common hobby in our love for books. It also helped that we were the closest in age among the three sisters."
#Souko
"What about Benio-san?"
#Rokuyou
"Benio is... a strange one."
With that, Rokuyou-san let out a strained smile.
#Souko
"Ah... she did seem like she was wearing a mask."
#Protagonist
"Really?"
Surprised, I looked over at Benio-san.
She seemed to be continuing her meal in a quiet, refined manner...
#Souko
"You didn't notice?"
#Protagonist
"Now that you mention it, she did seem much more casual when talking to Tsujimura-san, the manager."
#Souko
"See? I think that’s her true self."
#Protagonist
"...Sorry, I didn't catch that."
#Souko
"You're so slow. I bet that blunt way she was speaking to the coachman when we arrived is the real her."
#Rokuyou
"She likely adjusted her behavior because she was in front of guests. She's much more laid-back normally."
#Protagonist
"Hoh..."
She looks so much like a traditional Japanese doll that I just assumed she was always that quiet.
#Souko
"Well, we shouldn't just talk. Let's enjoy the food, shall we?"
#Protagonist
"R-Right."
The plate in front of me held a sautéed chicken.
The savory scent of garlic wafted up from it.
#Protagonist
"Oh, this is delicious."
The chicken wasn't too fatty, but it wasn't too lean either, leaving just the right amount of flavor.
#Mikanagi
"Narumi-san prepares all the food here."
#Souko
"Yes, so I've heard. Did she train somewhere?"
#Mikanagi
"It doesn't seem so. It’s just that her culinary skills are truly exceptional."
#Narumi
"That’s mean, Dr. Mikanagi. Saying 'just' my culinary skills."
Narumi-san, who had been serving nearby, approached us.
#Mikanagi
"I don't think there's any need for you to go acting all dainty."
Dr. Mikanagi spoke with a chuckle.
#Narumi
"Oh? Lady Benio does it, so I thought I'd give it a try. Is it no good?"
#Mikanagi
"It doesn't suit you at all."
#Narumi
"My, what a harsh thing to say. You think so too, don't you?"
...Why is she dragging me into this?
Agree with Narumi-san
Agree with Dr. Mikanagi
#Protagonist
"I don't think you should speak to women that way."
#Narumi
"Exactly! You tell him."
#Mikanagi
"Haha, you've got me there."
#Souko
"He's at that age where he wants to look good in front of girls, you see."
#Protagonist
"What is that supposed to mean...?"
#Protagonist
"Personally, I think it's better to just be your usual self."
#Narumi
"How mean! I'm always like this, you know?"
#Protagonist
"...I'm sorry. We just met, but it’s pretty obvious that isn't the real you, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"...Tch."
She gave me an incredibly sharp click of her tongue...
#Akane
"Narumi-san! Stop chatting and bring out the next course."
Akane-san appeared.
#Narumi
"Yeah, yeah, I'm on it~."
#Akane
"Good grief, please take this seriously!"
Akane-san shooed Narumi-san back toward the kitchen.
#Protagonist
"It seems Akane-san is the one in charge."
#Rokuyou
"She's definitely the more reliable of the two."
Rokuyou-san said with a smile.
#Narumi
"Next is the lobster bisque."
Bowls of red soup were placed on the table.
#Protagonist
"Is lobster different from spiny lobster?"
#Souko
"I believe they're actually closer to crawfish than regular lobsters."
#Protagonist
"Hoh..."
Either way, it was still a high-end ingredient as far as I was concerned.
#Protagonist
"Oh, this shrimp is delicious."
The meat was plump and packed with flavor.
#Souko
"...There's no shrimp in mine."
Souko-san muttered under her breath.
She spoke so softly I doubt anyone but me heard her.
Souko-san sat there, stirring her soup with the tip of her spoon.
#Protagonist
"Ah... um..."
#Souko
"...Technically, it's a bisque, so the shrimp are just for the stock. It's normal for there not to be any. It's not like I just have bad luck."
I silently glanced at the other people's soup.
There were visible chunks of shrimp in both Rokuyou-san's and Dr. Mikanagi's.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san... do you want some of mine?"
#Souko
"...I don't need your pity."
Souko-san muttered again, her voice dropping even lower.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01_2050.txt
********************
#Protagonist
"Phew..."
I was even treated to dessert after the meal.
I've never had such a lavish feast in my life.
As a representative of the common folk, I was thrilled that I didn't even have to worry about the bill.
I doubt I'll ever eat something like this at a top-tier restaurant ever again.
#Souko
"Glug, glug, glug... *ahhh*."
Souko-san was happily guzzling the Cola she'd brought from her room.
I wish she'd at least pour it into a glass.
I’ll just pray she doesn’t let out a massive burp.
When we stepped out of the grand dining hall, Benio-san was waiting in the hallway.
#Protagonist
"Thank you for the wonderful meal."
#Benio
"It was a modest offering. I am delighted that it was to your liking."
#Souko
"The wedding ceremony starts at midnight, right?"
#Benio
"Yes. We will begin various preparations after ten, so please feel free to spend your time as you wish indoors until then."
#Protagonist
"It sounds like it’s best if we stay in our rooms for a while after ten, then."
#Benio
"Indeed. I would appreciate that."
#Souko
"Oh, right, there was one thing I wanted to ask."
#Benio
"And what might that be?"
She tilted her head with a smile.
#Souko
"It's about the 'Curse of the Seven Possessions.'"
#Benio
"Oh? You wish to hear of it?"
#Souko
"Well, yeah. That's exactly what we came here to research."
Benio-san gave a slightly amused smile.
#Benio
"The 'Curse of the Seven Possessions' is, of course, a play on the Nanatsuki name, and as the title suggests, there are seven items to it."
#Benio
"However, it might be more accurate to call them 'seven wonders' rather than a curse."
#Souko
"And the details?"
#Benio
"Well, first—"
With that, Benio-san cut herself off.
#Akane
"Lady Benio, have you seen Aiko?"
Akane-san popped her head out from the kitchen.
#Benio
"Love? She's in my room."
#Akane
"I've prepared her food; what should I do with it?"
#Benio
"I'll take it to her. ...Now then, Kirihara-san, we shall continue our conversation later."
#Souko
"Sure."
With a polite bow, Benio-san walked off carrying the cat's food.
#Souko
"You go to her later and get the rest of the story."
#Protagonist
"Wait, me?"
She really should just go herself.
#Souko
"Doing the legwork is your job. I'll be in my room, so come let me know if you find anything out."
#Protagonist
"Alright, alright."
Well, this is how it always goes.
