What could it be...
"The Tale of a Certain Man - Chapter 4"
—However, the true nightmare was only just beginning. I thanked him and accepted the mountain of takoyaki.
Just as I thought he would finally leave, I heard words I couldn't believe.
"What's wrong? Aren't you gonna eat 'em?"
"I grilled these just for you, so don't be shy, dig in," he said.
If you grilled them for me, then why are they stone-cold? Aren't these just leftovers? I desperately swallowed those questions.
It was because I was certain I'd be killed otherwise. After a moment of hesitation, I chose the safe answer: I was tired now, so I'd have them later.
However, the man didn't seem to like that answer. His face contorted violently, showing an expression of terrifying sadness.
I was frozen in fear by that incredibly eerie expression. Then, as if to finish me off, the man said... ~To be continued~

I honestly told him they were disgusting. The man gave a satisfied smile and said this:

Yes, that was back when I held a recital in Ueno. Even now, I cannot forget that terrifying experience. I still remember it clearly even today.
And those terrifying eyes, clouded and grey... those were undoubtedly the eyes of someone who had killed many people on the battlefield.
On top of that, a complex gaze that seemed to plead for loneliness somehow... it planted such an inexplicably ominous and eerie impression in me.
Looking back, allowing that food stall to operate near the venue was probably the start of everything.
I had encountered that man with eyes full of both obsession and madness. ~To be continued~

That day's performance ended, and as I was catching my breath in the dressing room, that man from the food stall arrived with a massive amount of takoyaki.
"A thanks for lettin' me do business," the man replied bluntly.
However, that clearly excessive amount of takoyaki had already lost its heat, showing whether I liked it or not that they were leftovers.
I tried to refuse, but the man insisted there was no need for modesty and wouldn't listen.
To be honest, I didn't want them.
We continued that back-and-forth for a while, but finally worn down, I ended up accepting that forbidden thing.
It was because I was tired after the performance and wanted to get it over with quickly. ~To be continued~

"Hello, Benio-san. Do you have time right now?"
#Benio
"Yes, I don't mind."
Benio-san invited me into the room.
#Benio
"So, what do you want?"
Benio-san asks with a formal air.
#Satoshi
"Uh... well..."

The fireplace isn't lit, likely because no one is using the room.

There's another door in the back, separate from the one I entered through.

The wind and snow seem to be getting stronger than they were this evening.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
A painting is on display.
I don't know who the artist is, but it's a beautiful piece.
I've already searched here, so I'll look elsewhere.
The sheets on the bed don't have a single stain.
Probably because no one is using it.

I've come to the room at the far end of the east side of the second floor.
A grand piano is placed on a slightly elevated stage.
Now then, what should I do next?

--------------------
F01_24s.txt
********************
It looks like quite an antique piano.
I'm sure this is something Kousei-san used as well.
It seems it's been well-maintained even after his passing, as the surface is polished to a shine.

It seems instruments are kept in this room.
Now then, what should I do next...

--------------------
F01_25s.txt
********************
Is this... a trombone, I think?
Brass instruments all look similar, so I can't really tell.
It was likely part of Kousei-san's collection.
Many instruments are lined up.
A saxophone... I think.
They're lined up beautifully.
Many instruments are lined up.
A trumpet... no, maybe it is a trumpet.
There seem to be quite a few of them.
Every single one of them was shining brilliantly.
Many instruments are lined up.
There's also a door leading to the corridor behind me.
It looks like a door that cuts through to the performance room.

The room I entered seems to be a place for composing music.
Music stands and a small organ are placed here.
Now then, what should I do?

--------------------
F01_26s.txt
********************
Is this... an organ?
I can't really tell the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it's clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play a few notes, but it's probably not good to touch it without permission.
It seems to be an organ.
A musical score is placed on the desk.
It appears to be something Kousei-san was writing.
I don't really know, but it might be something valuable.
The title is... "Three Fragments," maybe?
It seems to be a piece titled "Three Fragments."
It looks like musical scores are stored inside the glass cabinet.
Scores by composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach, are lined up.
Many scores are stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san probably used it.
I've already searched here, so I'll look elsewhere.
Musical scores are pasted on the wall.
They were likely composed by Kousei-san.

A book has been left sitting on the music stand.
It makes it feel as though Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer was a piece of blank staff paper.
A small piece of wood is placed on top as a paperweight.
I'm curious about it, but I can't really take it for no reason...
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It's a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.

I've arrived at Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Souko
"Oh, it's you. What is it?"
#Satoshi
"Could we talk for a moment?"
#Souko
"I don't mind."
With that, Souko-san led me into the room.
#Souko
"So, did you find anything out?"
#Satoshi
"I'm still in the middle of investigating."
#Souko
"I see. Well, it's not like the mystery of the curse will be solved all at once."
#Satoshi
"So, about that..."
I've come to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Souko
"What, you again? What is it?"
#Satoshi
"Could we talk for a moment?"
#Souko
"Yes, that's fine."
With that, Souko-san led me into the room.
#Souko
"What is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"Uh... well..."

********************
I've come to the toilet on the second floor.
There's no one here.
What should I do...

--------------------
F01_28s.txt
********************
It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
The wind and snow seem to be getting stronger than they were this evening.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
I don't really need to go right now...
I'll come back when the urge strikes.
I don't have any particular business here.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are stored.
It contains rags, buckets, and so on.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It's just an ordinary mirror.
Of course, it's very clean and not cloudy at all.
A mirror is hanging on the wall.
When I turned the tap, cold water came out.
As expected, it might be a bit tough in this season.
The water has become very cold.

--------------------
F01_29.txt
********************
The far end of the north side of the second floor.
I'm told this is the room of the previous head of the family, Mr. Kousei.
I try turning the doorknob lightly, but naturally, it seems to be locked.
Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.

--------------------
F01_30.txt
********************
I've returned to my own room.
I don't really have anything to do, though...

--------------------
F01_30s.txt
********************
The fire in the fireplace is flickering.
Thanks to that, the room is warm.
If this wasn't here... I shudder to think.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the one leading to the corridor.
I wonder if it connects to the room next door...
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
I definitely saw something like a tower outside the window earlier.
Let's see what's out there once more.
I wiped the fog off the window and leaned closer.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
I can hear something.
A beautiful sound, distinct from the howling wind of the blizzard.
#Satoshi
"A song...?"
It's someone's singing voice.
Is that—coming from the tower?
I'm a little curious...
That singing voice from earlier... I'm curious about it...
A painting is displayed on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
I've already searched here, so I'll look elsewhere.
My bed for tonight.
Maybe because I rested a bit earlier, the sheets are wrinkled.
It was soft and very comfortable to sleep in.
There's still time until the wedding, so maybe I could go back to sleep for a bit...
I guess I could rest if I wanted to...
An old-fashioned, antique-style chest of drawers is placed here.
It seems nothing is inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing inside.
It's my bag.
It has plenty of spare clothes inside.
Since I never know when I'll be able to go home when Souko-san drags me along, I always bring extra.
Other than that, I just have a notebook and writing materials.
Oh right, I was going to fix the metal fitting on my bag.
I lightly crush the bag's clasp with the pliers I borrowed from the storage room.
The pliers seem quite loose, like they're about to break any moment.
#Satoshi
"Ah..."
A small knife tumbled out of my bag's pocket.
Oh right, I had put it in here...
It's not like I have a specific use for it, but I'll hold onto it just in case.
I don't need anything for now.

--------------------

********************
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi, who was at his desk, looked up.
#Mikanagi
"Oh, what is it?"
#Satoshi
"Do you have a moment?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, I don't mind."
Now then, what should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."

Now then, what should I do?

Maybe he's gone somewhere else.
Now then, what should I do?

--------------------
F01_31s.txt
********************
Small medicine bottles are lined up.
With my knowledge, I have no idea what most of these medicines are.
I shouldn't mess with them, so I'll just leave them be.
It's probably best not to mess with them.
There's something that looks like medicine inside.
I wonder if it's for herbal medicine; something that looks like tree roots is also stored here.
It's probably best not to mess with them.
Disinfectants, bandages, and such seem to be placed here.
I shouldn't mess with them, so I'll just leave them be.
It's probably best not to mess with them.
Some documents are placed on the desk.
I probably shouldn't look at them without permission.
Documents are placed here.
Snow is dancing outside the window.
The wind seems to have grown quite strong.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
There's another door, separate from the one I entered through.
It probably connects to the adjacent archive.
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
A simple bed, completely different from the ones in the other rooms, is placed here.
Well, it's an infirmary, so that makes sense...
There's no sign of the bed being used.
Various documents are stored here.
I really shouldn't look at them without permission...

In the bottom drawer, I found a pretty card.
#Satoshi
"What's this...?"
The card had the letter 'r' written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll hold onto it.
There's another piece of paper inside.
'Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and answer the question! The response section on the survey postcard was meant for this!'
#Satoshi
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I'm a little curious, so I'll hold onto this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
'Now all the cards have been collected! As for the question you're wondering about... if you rearrange the letters so far, they'll form a certain word.'
'Answer with a Japanese translation appropriate for this work and send in the survey postcard!'
'Deadline: Postmarked by January 11, 2010! 10 winners chosen by lottery will receive a small gift!'
#Satoshi
"...I see."
I kind of get it, but also not really...
Nothing unusual is inside.

--------------------
F01_32.txt
********************
This is Dr. Mikanagi's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Satoshi
"Huh... I guess he's not in."
There was no response, no matter how long I waited.
Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.

--------------------
F01_33.txt
********************
I'm pretty sure this was the archive.
I lightly turned the doorknob.
#Satoshi
"It's open...?"
Since I fully expected it to be locked, this was a bit of an anticlimax.
Well, if it's a room used regularly, I guess there's no need to lock it inside one's own home.
The room was almost entirely occupied by large bookshelves.
This place looks like it's worth investigating, but...

--------------------
F01_33s.txt
********************
Books titled "Complete Works of H.P. Lovecraft" are lined up.
I wonder who in this house reads these books...
The complete works of Lovecraft are placed here.
Books titled "Encyclopedia of Occultism" are lined up.
Whose books are these, I wonder...
Occult books are placed here.
Many foreign books, such as "The Key of Solomon" and "Grimorium Verum," are lined up.
Aren't these... those books called grimoires...?
Books of the type called grimoires are placed here.
Books compiling folk legends from the Tohoku region, starting with "Tono Monogatari," are placed here.
There don't seem to be any particularly unusual books.
Books related to Tohoku folklore are placed here.
"Die Geschichte deutscher Musik" is written on the cover.
Um... is this German? I don't really understand the content.
Musical symbols are written in it, so it must be related to that...
It seems to be a music book written in German.
It appears to be a German-Japanese dictionary.
With this, I could probably understand the meaning of words, but since I don't know the grammar and such, reading a book would be difficult.
A German-Japanese dictionary is placed here.
This is... it seems to be a travel guidebook written in German.
I'd like to visit someday, but that's impossible...
It looks like a German travel guide.
Is this... a mystery novel, maybe?
It seems to be about a detective staying at a brothel who solves a series of murders in Ueno.
The title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading in a place like this. I'll save it for another time.
A mystery novel is placed here.
This book apparently deals with German war history.
It's about the two World Wars and the subsequent division into East and West.
It seems to be a German history book.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It was a music textbook.
Scales and whatnot; I don't really get it.
It says things like "Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do" is "C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C" in English, and further "C-D-E-F-G-A-H-C" in Germany.
I don't even want to remember my music grades...
A music textbook is placed here.
#Satoshi
"Hm...?"
A scrap of paper tucked into the book caught my eye.
What could it be...
"The Tale of a Certain Man - Chapter 1"
My name is Nanatsuki Kousei. I am a mere composer.
I have decided to leave a record of an experience here. It was an event too hideous to keep locked away in my own heart.
Whoever finds this, read it with caution. ~To be continued~
#Satoshi
"...What the hell is this?"
A scrap of paper titled "The Tale of a Certain Man - Chapter 1" is tucked inside.
A book titled "Deutsche Architektur" is placed here.
It depicts Western castles with photos and diagrams, so it must be some kind of commentary or reference book.
It seems to be a book related to German architecture.
This book... apparently it's a story where the protagonist, a piano player, gets caught up in strange incidents.
Given who the protagonist is, it might not be out of place in this house.
Um, the title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading in a place like this. I'll save it for another time.
It seems to be a mystery novel.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like an architecture book.
Apparently, the notation for floor levels differs between the UK and the US, even in English-speaking countries.
Even for the same second floor, it's "2F" in the US but "1F" in the UK.
That's bound to be confusing...
The word for "floor" is "Floor" in English and apparently "Stock" in German.
It seems to be an architectural study book.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like a map commentary book.
It says things like "North, South, East, West" are "N, S, E, W" in English and become "N, S, O, W" in German.
Only "East" changes... well, I guess everything except the initial letter is different.
A map commentary book is placed here.
It appears to be a mystery novel.
It's a story about a detective chasing a serial killer of schoolgirls.
A girl who's the spitting image of a woman depicted in a strange painting and a bug-loving younger sister appear.
Um, the title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading in a place like this. I'll save it for another time.
A mystery novel is placed here.

********************
Before going to the tower, I should first try asking Tsujimura-san in the office.
I should probably get permission from Tsujimura-san before going to the tower.
I go out through the door in the back of the office and walk through the garden where the snow continues to fall to approach the tower.
Likely due to the heavy blizzard, I can't hear the singing.
Perhaps she isn't singing anymore.
The door at the base of the tower was open.
When I stepped inside, I heard a singing voice from above.
The interior was empty, with stairs winding upwards along the wall.
I decided to try going up the stairs.
At the top of the stairs was a door.
This must be Shion-san's room.
I stood there for a while, listening to her song.
Eventually, the voice ceased.
It was then that I lightly knocked on the door for the first time.
#???
"Who is it... Seiji?"
#Satoshi
"Um, excuse me. My name is (NAME01) (NAME02), and I was rescued by this household. I wanted to offer a word of greeting."
#???
"I see... I'm not in a position to say, but please, make yourself at home."
She must be on guard; there's no sign of her opening the door from the inside.
#Satoshi
"Yes. ...So, it sounded like you were singing just now."
#???
"Y-Yes... is something wrong with that...?"
#Satoshi
"You have a beautiful singing voice."
#???
"Eh... A-Ah, thank you..."
#Satoshi
"Oh, and congratulations on your wedding."
#???
"...Thank you."
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going now. ...Excuse me."
I was concerned that she seemed somewhat listless, but I decided to leave the area.
Once outside, I looked up at the tower.
Shion-san...
Why is she in a place so far removed?
I want to hear her voice once more.
I enter the tower and head up the stairs.
I knock lightly on the door.
#???
"Yes...?"
#Satoshi
"Hello, it's (NAME01)."
#???
"Do you need something...?"
#Satoshi
"I thought we might talk for a bit..."
#???
"...I'm sorry, but I have preparations for the ceremony..."
#Satoshi
"Ah, right. Sorry for bothering you."
I decided to make a hasty retreat.
