That looks like a remarkably expensive sofa.

I carefully pull open the glass door to peer inside and find a small fragment of wood.

What could this be...?
'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Two'
Yes, that was back when I was holding a concert in Ueno. Even now, I cannot forget that terrifying experience. I remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday.
And those eyes... clouded with a terrifying grey... they were undoubtedly the eyes of one who had slaughtered many on the battlefield.
Furthermore, he possessed a complex gaze that seemed to cry out from some profound loneliness; it left me with an indescribably ominous and eerie impression.
Looking back now, I realize that allowing that stall to operate near the venue was the beginning of everything.
I had crossed paths with a man whose eyes held both obsession and madness. ~To be continued~

Hey, do you get it? What takoyaki needs isn't flavor—it's about making the customer who bought it feel a little bit of happiness.
Whether it tastes good or bad isn't what's truly necessary. At least, that's how I've lived my life.

"I wonder..."
Narumi-san crouches down and inserts a wire into the keyhole on the floor.
#Narumi
"The first time with a lock is always the hardest..."
Narumi-san struggled with it for a while, but eventually stood up, seemingly having given up.
#Narumi
"It'll be faster to just find the actual key."
#Protagonist
"I see... but where would the real key be...?"
#Narumi
"To begin with, it was a mistake to decode the second half of the cipher first. I think we'll get the key once we solve the first half."
#Protagonist
"The first half...?"
The first half of '1SO K H5 / 1SN KAMIN'.
#Protagonist
"At the very least, I think we've established that '1SN KAMIN' refers to the fireplace in the north of the second floor..."
Just then, Narumi-san clapped her hands together.
#Narumi
"I've got it! It's the European floor numbering. Didn't they call the first floor the ground floor?"
#Protagonist
"So the second floor is '1F'... which makes it '1S' in this case."
#Narumi
"So the first half is also on the second floor... but where's 'O'?"
#Protagonist
"Could it be the center...? But there's nothing in the middle of the second floor."
#Narumi
"...Well, we'll manage somehow if we just keep at it like we did when we found this place."
#Protagonist
"But 'K H5' isn't as obvious as a fireplace..."
#Narumi
"But it's definitely something, so let's give it a shot."
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
There's no point in investigating here further until we find the key.

I’ve returned to my own room.
There's a fireplace here too, of course...
I’ve returned again.
#Narumi
"Weren't we just here?"
#Protagonist
"Well, yes..."
#Narumi
"If you still want to investigate, then make it quick."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
I’ve returned to my own room.
#Narumi
"Want to see if we can find a key? I've no idea if we'll find anything searching blindly like this, though."

I searched the area, but I couldn't find anything resembling a key.
A bright red fire flickers within the hearth.
#Protagonist
"Wait... this is impossible."
It's far too hot to investigate.
#Narumi
"I don't think this is the fireplace the code meant, anyway..."
#Protagonist
"If we can't find anything elsewhere, let's come back and check it again later."
#Narumi
"I think that's for the best."
It's simply too hot to even attempt an investigation.
There's a door on a different wall from the hallway side.
It seems to connect to the adjacent room.
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A painting is hanging on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
I've already finished searching here, so let's look elsewhere.
This is the bed I slept in.
It was soft and I slept very well.
I just woke up, so I'm not particularly sleepy...
If you want to rest, I think it's fine to take a break...
There's an old, antique-style chest of drawers here.
It appears to be empty inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing inside.
This is my bag.
It's mostly packed with a change of clothes.
When I'm dragged along by Souko-san, I never know when I'll be able to go home, so I always bring extra.
Other than that, there's just my notebook and writing tools.
I don't need anything from it right now.

Musical symbols are written in it, so it must be related to that...

A book titled 'Deutsche Architektur' is sitting here.
It's filled with photographs and illustrations of Western castles, so it must be some kind of commentary or guide on the subject.
It seems to be a book related to German architecture.
This book... appears to be a story about a protagonist who is a piano player getting caught up in a strange incident.

It looks like a mystery novel.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like an architecture book.
Apparently, the floor numbering differs between British and American English.
Even for the same second floor, the US uses '2F', while the UK uses '1F'.
That's definitely going to be confusing...
It says the word for 'floor' is 'Floor' in English, and 'Stock' in German.
It looks like a book on architecture.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like a commentary on maps.
It says things like 'North, South, East, West' are represented as 'N, S, E, W' in English, and become 'N, S, O, W' in German.
So only East changes... well, I guess everything besides the first letter changes too.
A map commentary is sitting here.
It appears to be a mystery novel.
It's a story about a detective chasing a serial killer of schoolgirls.

—However, the true nightmare began from that point. I offered my thanks and accepted the mountain of takoyaki.
Just as I thought he would finally leave, I heard words I couldn't believe.
"What's the matter? Aren't you gonna eat 'em?"
He said he'd grilled them specifically for me, so I shouldn't hesitate to dig in.
I desperately swallowed back the question: 'If you grilled these for me, why are they so stone-cold? Aren't these just leftovers?'
I did so because I was certain I'd be killed otherwise. After a moment's hesitation, I chose the safest answer: that I was tired and would enjoy them later.
However, the man didn't seem to care for that response. His face contorted violently, and he wore a look of terrifying sorrow.
That expression was so eerie it froze me in my tracks with fear. As if to strike a finishing blow, the man added... ~To be continued~

He answered bluntly that it was thanks for letting him do business there.
However, those obviously excessive takoyaki had already lost their heat, indicating all too clearly that they were leftovers.
I tried to refuse, but the man wouldn't listen, insisting that I didn't need to be modest.

I quietly open the door.
Naturally, nobody is inside.
Now then, what should I do.

--------------------
F02_22s.txt
********************
The fire isn't lit, likely because nobody is using the room.
Because of that, it felt a bit cold inside.
The fire isn't lit in the hearth.
There is another door further inside, separate from the one we entered through.
It likely connects to the adjacent room.
It seems to be a door connecting to the next room over.
The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A painting is on display.
I don't know who the artist is, but it's a beautiful piece.
I've already finished searching here, so let's look elsewhere.
There isn't a single stain on the sheets covering the bed.
Likely because nobody has been using it.
There is no sign of the bed having been used.

It looks like a remarkably vintage piano.
I’m sure this is another thing Kousei-san used to use.

F02_25s.txt
********************
This is... a trombone, right?
Brass instruments all look so similar to me that I can’t really tell them apart.
It was probably part of Kousei-san's collection.
There are so many instruments lined up here.
A saxophone... I think.
They're all arranged so beautifully.
There are so many instruments lined up here.
A horn... no, wait, a trumpet.
There seems to be quite a significant number of them.
Every single one of them is shining brilliantly.

********************
Is this... an organ?
I don't really know the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it’s clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play it for a second, but it’s probably not a good idea to touch things without permission.
It appears to be an organ.
There's some sheet music sitting on the desk.
It looks like something Kousei-san was in the middle of writing.
I don't really get it, but maybe it’s something valuable.
The title is... 'Three Fragments', maybe?
It seems to be a piece of music titled 'Three Fragments'.
The glass cabinet seems to be filled with sheet music.
Scores from composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach, are lined up there.
A lot of sheet music is stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san probably used it.
I’ve already checked here, so let's look somewhere else.
Sheet music is pasted onto the wall.
It was likely composed by Kousei-san.

A book has been left lying on the music stand.
It’s almost as if Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer, I found some blank staff paper.
A small wood fragment is being used as a paperweight.
I’m curious about it, but I can't exactly just take it if there's no reason to...
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It looks like a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.

"Well, I don't mind."

Nobody is here.

I don't really feel the need to go right now...
I’ll come back if I have to.
I don't really have any business here.
It’s a locker where cleaning supplies and such are kept.
It contains things like rags and buckets.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It’s a perfectly ordinary mirror.
Naturally, it's very clean and not at all foggy.
A mirror hangs upon the wall.
When I turn the tap, ice-cold water comes out.
As expected, this might be a bit rough during this season.
The water has become very cold.

********************
The far end of the second floor's north side.
This is the room that belonged to the previous head of the house, Kousei-shi.

********************
I’ve returned to my own room.
I don't really have anything to do, though...

The fire in the hearth is flickering.
Thanks to that, the room is warm.
If it weren't for this... it’s a terrifying thought.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the hallway side.
I wonder if it connects to the room next door...
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
Everything outside the window is white.
I guess it's still blizzard-like out there this morning.
I couldn't even see the tower across from me.
It seems to still be a blizzard outside.
A painting is hanging on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
I’ve already checked here, so let's look somewhere else.
This is the bed I slept in last night.
It was soft, and I slept very well.
The wedding ceremony continuation is starting soon, so maybe I should just wait in my room until then...
If you want to rest, I think it's fine to take a break...
There's an old, antique-style chest of drawers here.
It appears to be empty inside.
It’s likely for guests; there’s nothing inside.
This is my bag.
It’s mostly packed with a change of clothes.
When I'm dragged along by Souko-san, I never know when I'll be able to go home, so I always bring extra.
Other than that, there’s just my notebook and writing tools.
Oh right, I was going to fix the hardware on my bag.
I use the pliers I borrowed from the storage room to lightly crush the bag's clasp.
The pliers seem to be quite worn out, as if they’re about to break any minute.
#Protagonist
"Ah..."
A small knife tumbled out of my bag's pocket.
Oh yeah, I did put that in here...
I don't have any particular use for it, but I'll hold onto it for now.
I don't need anything from it right now.

When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei, who had been at his desk, looked up.

Small medicine vials are lined up here.
With my limited knowledge, I have almost no idea what kind of medicines they are.
I can't go meddling with them, so I'll just leave them be.
It’s probably best not to meddle with it.
It contains things that look like medicine.
Maybe it’s for herbal medicine; there are even things that look like tree roots stored here.

There's a door other than the one I entered through.
It likely connects to the library next door.
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
There's a simple bed here, completely different from the ones in the other rooms.
Well, it is an infirmary, so that makes sense...

"What's this...?"
The card has the letter 'r' written on it.
I’m a bit curious, so I think I’ll hang onto it.
There’s another piece of paper inside.
'Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and solve the problem! This is what the answer section on the survey postcard was for!'
#Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I’m at least a little curious, so I’ll hold onto this card.
There’s another piece of paper inside.
'Now all the cards have been collected! Now for the burning question... if you rearrange the letters so far, they form a certain word.'
'Answer with the Japanese translation most suitable for this work and send in your survey postcard!'
'Deadline is January 11, 2010, postmark valid! We’ll send a small gift to 10 lucky winners!'
#Protagonist
"...Geez."
I kind of get it, but I kind of don't...
There's nothing particularly unusual inside.

"I’m sorry... but if you have business, could we do it later in the infirmary? I'm still sleepy."
#Protagonist
"Oh... sorry about that. I'll see you later then."
#御巫
"Yes, please do."
Mikanagi-sensei looked incredibly sleepy.
Maybe he's just not a morning person.
I can't just stand around here forever, so let's try somewhere else.
I’ve come to the front of Mikanagi-sensei's room.
Just as I was about to knock, I remembered.
He said if I had business, to see him in the infirmary.
I should wait a while and then head to the infirmary.
I decided to leave the area.

This place looks like it’s worth investigating, but...

--------------------

********************
Books titled 'The Complete Works of H.P. Lovecraft' are lined up on the shelf.
I have to wonder... who in this house actually reads these...?
The complete works of Lovecraft are sitting here.
Books titled 'The Encyclopedia of Occultism' are lined up on the shelf.
I wonder whose they are...
Occult books are placed here.
Many foreign books, such as 'The Key of Solomon' and 'Grimorium Verum', are lined up here.
Aren't these... if I remember right, what people call grimoires...?
Books of the sort known as grimoires are placed here.
There are books collecting folk legends from the Tohoku region, starting with 'Tono Monogatari'.
There don't seem to be any particularly unusual books.
Books regarding the folklore of Tohoku are placed here.
'Die Geschichte deutscher Musik' is written on the cover.
Um... is this German? I can't really understand the content.
Musical symbols are written in it, so it must be related to that...
It appears to be a music book written in German.
It seems to be a German-Japanese dictionary.
With this, I might be able to understand the meaning of individual words, but without knowing the grammar and such, reading a book still looks difficult.
A German-Japanese dictionary is sitting here.
This is... it looks like a travel guidebook written in German.
I'd like to visit someday, but that's just not possible...
It looks like a German travel guide.
Is this... a mystery novel, perhaps?
It seems to be about a detective staying at a brothel who solves a series of murders in Ueno.
The title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading here. I'll save it for another time.

It appears this book covers German military history.
It's written about the two World Wars and the subsequent division into East and West.

It was a music textbook.
Scales and whatnot; I don't really understand it.

I don't even want to think back on my music grades...
A music textbook is sitting here.
#Protagonist
"Hm...?"
A scrap of paper tucked into the book caught my eye.
What could this be...?
'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter One'
My name is Nanatsuki Kousei. I am a mere composer.
I have decided to leave a record of a certain experience here. It was because the events were too hideous to keep locked away in my own heart alone.
Let those who find this read it with caution. ~To be continued~
#Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
A scrap of paper titled 'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter One' is tucked inside.
A book titled 'Deutsche Architektur' is sitting here.
It's filled with photographs and illustrations of Western castles, so it must be some kind of commentary or guide on the subject.
It seems to be a book related to German architecture.
This book... appears to be a story about a protagonist who is a piano player getting caught up in a strange incident.
Given the protagonist's profession, it might not be out of place in this house.
Um, the title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading here. I'll save it for another time.
It looks like a mystery novel.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like an architecture book.
Apparently, the floor numbering differs between British and American English.
Even for the same second floor, the US uses '2F', while the UK uses '1F'.
That's definitely going to be confusing...
It says the word for 'floor' is 'Floor' in English, and 'Stock' in German.
It looks like a book on architecture.
I flip through a book that caught my eye.
It looks like a commentary on maps.
It says things like 'North, South, East, West' are represented as 'N, S, E, W' in English, and become 'N, S, O, W' in German.
So only East changes... well, I guess everything besides the first letter changes too.
A map commentary is sitting here.
It appears to be a mystery novel.
It's a story about a detective chasing a serial killer of schoolgirls.
A girl who is a spitting image of a woman in a strange painting and a bug-loving younger sister appear in it.
Um, the title is... oops, I can't afford to get absorbed in reading here. I'll save it for another time.

I exit through the door at the back of the office and walk through the garden where the snow continues to fall, approaching the tower.
It’s incredibly cold.
I guess coming out here so lightly dressed was a mistake after all.
The area around the tower door had been properly cleared of snow.
However...
#Protagonist
"...It’s locked."
I guess that’s only natural, since Shion-san is in the cathedral.
Nothing for it; let's head back.
I stepped out from behind the office and began to shiver.
No, no, Shion-san is still in the cathedral, so there's no point in going any further.
So, I decided to head back inside the mansion.

"Is this enough for you?"
#Protagonist
"Yes, thank you."
#Souko
"Then keep up the good work with the investigation."
#Protagonist
"Will do."
I decided to go somewhere else.

"Is that all, then?"
#Protagonist
"Yes, thank you. You seem busy before the wedding, so I'll take my leave now."
I bowed and decided to go somewhere else.

"Is that all, then?"

"Yes, thank you. You seem busy, so I'll be going."
I bowed and decided to go somewhere else.

"Then I'll be on my way. Thanks again."

"Sure thing. Come back again soon."
I decided to go somewhere else.
Now then, what should I do next...?
