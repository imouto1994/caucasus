********************
#Satoshi
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
I set the plates of fried rice down in front of the four people in the dining room—Souko-san, Benio-san, Akane-san, and Tsujimura-san.
#Benio
"Did you perform a poison test?"
It seems Benio-san was thinking the exact same thing I was.
#Satoshi
"I ate some myself before portioning it out."
#Benio
"I see. And? How was it?"
#Satoshi
"It was delicious."
#Benio
"...Then there shouldn't be a problem."
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san ate some before portioning it out, too."
#Benio
"Hmm... in that case, there shouldn't be any issue at all."
After making sure Benio-san picked up her spoon, Souko-san and the others began their meal as well.
#Souko
"...Mm, it really is delicious."
#Benio
"Well, her skills are certainly genuine."
#Akane
"Though, watching her while she was making it, you'd never imagine it would turn out like this."
#Tsujimura
"That's true... I'd like her to handle other tasks as well, but..."
#Narumi
"...I can hear you, you know."
Narumi-san emerged from the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Could you take some food to Madam and Shion-ojousama as well?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, understood."
I was handed three plates piled with fried rice.
For Maya-san, Shion-san, and Dr. Mikanagi, I assume.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san... is it still impossible for her?"
#Narumi
"Likely. Also, that lawyer said he didn't want any, so there's no need to feed him."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
First, I'll head to the infirmary to check on Ai-san's condition.

--------------------
02a_1515.txt
********************
I arrived in front of the infirmary, knocked lightly on the door, and then opened it.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me. I brought lunch."
Dr. Mikanagi and Maya-san were in the infirmary.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, thank you."
#Maya
"...Thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"I'll leave them here."
I placed the plates on Dr. Mikanagi's desk.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san is—"
I turned toward the bed—
#Ai
"Um..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
Ai-san had her eyes open and was looking up at me.
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
#Ai
"Yes... thank you very much."
Ai-san offered her thanks in a raspy voice.
#Ai
"Um... you were the one who saved me, weren't you...?"
#Satoshi
"...I was just lucky."
I gently took Ai-san's timidly extended hand and returned it to her chest.
#Mikanagi
"Her throat is quite sore, so it's best if she doesn't talk too much."
#Ai
"Okay..."
#Satoshi
"Um, can you... eat some food?"
At my question, Ai-san shook her head.
She had been strangled by the neck, so it's only natural that she can't.
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going now."
I wanted to ask Ai-san about what happened during the incident, but I held back and left the infirmary.

--------------------
02a_1520.txt
********************
Now I just have to deliver food to Shion-san.
I passed through the office and headed outside.
The snow was still falling as persistently as ever.
The door was unlocked.
Wanting to get the fried rice to her before it got cold, I hurried up the stairs.
I stood in front of Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me. I've brought lunch."
The door opened, and Shion-san peeked her face out.
#Shion
"Ah... thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san has regained consciousness as well."
#Shion
"Is that true!? ...Thank goodness..."
Shion-san let out a long sigh of relief.
#Satoshi
"The culprit hasn't been identified yet, so please don't let your guard down."
#Shion
"Y-Yes..."
Well, if she stays separated in a place like this, there probably isn't much to worry about.
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going."
#Shion
"A-Ah, um...!"
#Satoshi
"Yes?"
#Shion
"Please... b-be careful..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
After answering Shion-san, I decided to return to the dining room.

--------------------
02a_1530.txt
********************
I returned to the dining room.
#Satoshi
"Oh, where's Souko-san?"
Souko-san was nowhere to be seen.
#Benio
"It seems she went back to her room."
Benio-san was relaxing while drinking cocoa.
Tsujimura-san and Narumi-san weren't there either.
#Benio
"I suppose she can't settle down in a place where a murderer might be right next door."
#Satoshi
"How about you, Benio-san?"
#Benio
"Me? ...Well, I suppose it's the same for me."
#Satoshi
"...Are you actually feeling anxious?"
#Benio
"I am a delicate maiden, after all."
Benio-san blurted out something quite unexpected.
No, she's right, of course, but she had an air about her that made it seem like she was somehow enjoying the situation.
#Satoshi
"...I see."
Of course, I couldn't say that to her face, so I stayed silent.
With Rokuyou-san killed and Ai-san attacked, there's no telling when Benio-san might be targeted.
#Satoshi
"...Please be careful too, Benio-san."
#Benio
"What's this? Are you that worried about me?"
The corners of Benio-san's mouth curled up.
#Satoshi
"Of course I am."
#Benio
"...I see."
Benio-san suddenly crossed her arms as if lost in thought.
#Benio
"...Hey, are you—"
Benio-san's words were cut short by the sudden meowing of a cat.
#Benio
"...Is Love worried too?"
#Benio
"Hehe... I see."
Benio-san picked up the cat.
#Benio
"—I'll be heading back to my room as well."
#Satoshi
"Is that so... Um, what you were about to say just now—"
#Benio
"...It's nothing. Forget it."
Benio-san turned her face away.
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"Well then, see you later."
Benio-san left the dining room.
I wonder what she wanted to say...
#???
"...Um, are you finished?"
#Satoshi
"Whoa!?"
Startled by the sudden voice, I turned around to find Akane-san standing there looking apologetic.
#Satoshi
"A-Akane-san..."
#Akane
"...I thought it would be rude to interrupt since the two of you seemed to be in your own little world..."
#Satoshi
"...No, that wasn't the case at all..."
#Akane
"I-Is that so...?"
How should I put it... this person is quite unusual too...
#Akane
"Oh, that's right."
Akane-san brought over a plate piled with fried rice.
#Akane
"Um, I'd like you to take this to Takamine-sama..."
#Satoshi
"Eh? But Takamine-san said he didn't want any..."
#Akane
"Even if he says that, he needs to eat. Please tell him that the poison test has been done, so he can rest easy."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
Well, it might be better for me to take it rather than Akane-san or the others from this house.

--------------------
02a_1545.txt
********************
I left the dining room and headed to the north hallway on the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Takamine-san, it's me."
The door opened.
#Takamine
"Do you need something?"
A blunt Takamine-san appeared, though he didn't seem particularly displeased.
#Satoshi
"I brought food. And... can we talk for a bit?"
There are a few things I want to confirm.
#Takamine
"...I don't mind."
Takamine-san opened the door wide.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
Takamine-san's room was neatly organized.
A photo frame was placed on top of the shelf.
I wonder if that's the photo Narumi-san was talking about.
#Takamine
"Well, have a seat."
Takamine-san offered me a chair, so I sat down quietly.
I can't see the photo from here.
#Takamine
"I believe I said I didn't need any food."
#Satoshi
"But you won't last long if you don't eat, you know? A poison test has been done, so there's no problem."
#Takamine
"...Hmph."
Takamine-san reluctantly accepted the plate of fried rice.
He placed the plate on the shelf and knocked over the photo frame.
#Takamine
"—So, what did you want to talk about?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, um... I wanted to ask about Mr. Kousei's will..."
Takamine-san's gaze sharpened.
#Takamine
"...Do you think I can tell that to an outsider?"
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right, of course..."
I guess it's impossible after all...
#Takamine
"...However, given the situation."
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Takamine
"You're looking for the culprit, aren't you? It might provide some sort of clue."
It seems Takamine-san is willing to cooperate.
#Satoshi
"T-Thank you very much."
#Takamine
"Mind you, it's only what I remember. Mainly the method of distributing the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"That's more than enough. ...I heard that even if Rokuyou-san married Shion-san, there would be no benefit."
#Takamine
"Ah... that matter."
#Satoshi
"Is that because Shion-san is adopted?"
#Takamine
"I don't know what his personal motives were. However, the will stated that the inheritance was to be divided equally among Nanatsuki Maya, Nanatsuki Ai, and Nanatsuki Benio, one-third each."
#Satoshi
"If that's the case... then Shion-san really wouldn't receive a single cent."
#Takamine
"If she had married Rokuyou-kun, she would have gained access to the Rokuyou family's assets. But even that is no longer possible."
#Satoshi
"Was this marriage proposed by Rokuyou-san?"
#Takamine
"That's what I heard. I don't know what his intentions were, but Maya-san was said to be delighted."
#Satoshi
"Was it just getting rid of a nuisance after all...?"
#Takamine
"...Perhaps."
Takamine-san let out a long breath.
#Takamine
"That's about all I can tell you."
#Satoshi
"Thank you very much."
I wanted to ask more, but this seemed like the right time to stop.
#Satoshi
"Well then, excuse me."

--------------------
02a_1600.txt
********************
I returned to my room.
#Satoshi
"Phew..."
I flopped down onto the bed.
I feel strangely exhausted.
I suppose it's only natural... Rokuyou-san was killed this morning, and Ai-san was attacked at midday...
The culprit is likely still hiding somewhere, but at least I was able to save Ai-san.
I should at least be happy about that.
The culprit... who could it be?
I don't want to doubt anyone, but the culprit must undoubtedly be among the people I've met here.
If this series of crimes is related to the inheritance, it doesn't explain why Rokuyou-san was killed first.
After all, he had no right to the inheritance to begin with.
That being said, I haven't found any other clues that link the two incidents.
Other than the fact that Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were on good terms.
If only I could talk to Ai-san...
I closed my eyes.
I'll sleep... just for a bit.
I locked the door, so it should be fine.
Besides... I'm an outsider, so there's no reason for me to be targeted.
...Though that doesn't mean I can afford to be careless.

--------------------
02a_1630.txt
********************
I woke up to the sound of someone knocking on the door.
I checked the clock.
It seems I had been asleep for about thirty minutes.
I wonder who it is...
#Satoshi
"I'll open it now."
I approached the door, unlocked it, and peeked out into the hallway through a narrow opening.
#Satoshi
"Oh... Ai-san."
Ai-san was in the hallway.
#Ai
"Um... do you have a moment?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes... please come in."
I immediately opened the door wide and invited Ai-san inside.
#Satoshi
"Are you feeling alright now...?"
#Ai
"Yes... my throat still hurts a little, but there's no need to worry. I was just on my way back to my room, but I wanted to say a word of thanks..."
#Satoshi
"No... I didn't really do anything special..."
#Ai
"That's not true. You saved my life."
Ai-san bowed deeply.
#Satoshi
"Um... by the way, this might be very difficult to ask, but do you remember anything from when you were attacked?"
#Ai
"That..."
Ai-san looked down.
#Satoshi
"...I won't force you. But if you do, I think we can prevent something like this from happening again."
#Ai
"Yes... you're right."
Ai-san nodded.
#Ai
"But... I don't remember much either."
#Satoshi
"You don't remember...?"
#Ai
"After I went up to the clock room in the attic... I was hit from behind and lost consciousness..."
#Satoshi
"You don't know who it was?"
#Ai
"I... I didn't know."
Ai-san shook her head.
#Satoshi
"Then... why did you go to the attic?"
#Ai
"There was... a note in my room. It said to come to the attic at 11:40."
#Satoshi
"Did you recognize the handwriting?"
#Ai
"...No, I didn't."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
If that's the case, it makes Ai-san's reason for going to the attic even more mysterious.
With Rokuyou-san killed and the culprit still at large, would someone really respond to a summons written in unfamiliar handwriting?
Furthermore, she had thrown that note into the fireplace and burned it.
#Satoshi
"...Ai-san, could you tell if the handwriting on that note belonged to a man or a woman?"
#Ai
"I... I couldn't tell that either."
#Satoshi
"I see... Sorry for questioning you like this."
#Ai
"No... I'm the one who should be sorry for not remembering anything..."
We both bowed to each other.
I should leave it at that for now.
Ai-san has only just recovered, after all.
#Ai
"Um, and so... I'd like to thank you..."
Ai-san timidly made the offer.
#Satoshi
"A thank you... No, really, that's not necessary."
#Ai
"But... I want to..."
Saying so, Ai-san clung to me.
#Satoshi
"Eh...!? A-Ai-san...!?"
My slender frame couldn't support her weight, and we tumbled onto the bed.
Her voluptuous body was pressed against mine.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
I gently placed my hands on Ai-san's shoulders.
Embrace her
Don't embrace her
#Satoshi
"...You're still not feeling well, right? You shouldn't overexert yourself."
I pulled away from Ai-san's body.
#Ai
"But... I'm fine..."
#Satoshi
"I'm a man too, so I'm happy you'd offer. But... I think doing something like that as a 'thank you' is a bit different."
I stood up from the bed.
#Ai
"Are you... actually dating Kirihara-san...?"
#Satoshi
"That's not it. Souko-san isn't really a romantic interest; she's more like someone I admire."
#Satoshi
"She has her sloppy moments, but she's sharp... and, how do I say it, she's cool."
#Ai
"...Is that so."
Ai-san let out a sigh.
#Ai
"There was a time... when I felt that way too. But... those kinds of feelings never come true, do they...?"
#Satoshi
"Ai-san... are you talking about Rokuyou-san...?"
She neither denied nor confirmed it.
She simply lowered her eyes sorrowfully.
#Ai
"...I was blessing the future of those two... but I... loved him much more..."
Ai-san began to sob.
I couldn't say anything; I could only gently support her shoulders.
#Satoshi
"I'm... a man too. You can't expect me to hold back when you're pressing me like this..."
#Ai
"You don't have to... hold back, you know...?"
Ai-san's lips drew closer.

--------------------
02a_1640h.txt
********************
#Ai
"Ngh... mm, ah..."
Ai-san's lips pressed against mine, sealing my mouth.
#Ai
"Mmm... chu... ngh..."
She sucked at my lips, her tongue licking against mine.
#Ai
"Mnh, nnh... haa, amm... ngh..."
I responded to the deep kiss by sticking my tongue out in return.
#Ai
"Ngh... chu, slurp, ngh... haah..."
We sucked on each other's mouths, our tongues entining.
#Ai
"Mnh... ngh, haah..."
As Ai-san pulled away, a string of saliva dripped from her mouth.
#Satoshi
"...You're unexpectedly bold."
#Ai
"Do you despise me for it?"
#Satoshi
"No... I just thought it was surprising."
#Ai
"Hehe... when you live in a rural place like this, there aren't many other pleasures."
#Satoshi
"Is that so...?"
#Ai
"Don't worry, you are the first gentleman for me."
#Satoshi
"Eh—ngh!?"
Before I could say anything, Ai-san sealed my lips again.
#Ai
"Mmm, chu... haam, ngh... mnh..."
Ai-san's tongue ravaged the inside of my mouth.
#Ai
"Nnh... ngh, ah... haam, mnh, mmm..."
I put my tongue into her mouth as well.
#Ai
"Ngh... ngh, chu, chupa... ah, haah..."
Ai-san let out a hot breath.
#Ai
"Mnh... how... is this part...?"
Ai-san's hand reached down and touched my lower body.
#Satoshi
"Eh... A-Ai-san...?"
#Ai
"Aha... it's so hot..."
Ai-san's fingers wrapped around my exposed penis.
#Satoshi
"Ugh..."
#Ai
"Ufu... I can tell you're feeling it..."
Ai-san's fingertips traced along the underside of my shaft.
#Ai
"This feels good, doesn't it...?"
She sandwiched my rod between her index and middle fingers, rubbing the rim of the glans.
#Ai
"Hehe... it's turned so red... it looks like it's about to burst..."
#Satoshi
"A-Ai-san... if you keep messing with it there..."
#Ai
"Will it come out...?"
Ai-san's finger moved as if digging into the urethral opening.
#Satoshi
"Ugh..."
Unable to endure it, pre-cum leaked out.
#Ai
"Ah... look, it's coming out..."
Ai-san smiled mischievously as she spread the fluid over the glans with her fingertips.
#Ai
"Mnh... is this Cowper's fluid...?"
#Satoshi
"I believe that's the formal name for it..."
#Ai
"Then, there's still more to come, right...?"
Ai-san's eyes sparkled with anticipation.
#Satoshi
"Yeah, well..."
#Ai
"Mnh... then I'll... do even more for you..."
Ai-san began to slowly rub my meat stick in a circular motion.
#Satoshi
"Ngh..."
#Ai
"Hehe... so cute... chu, ngh..."
Giggling, Ai-san brought her lips close.
#Ai
"Mmm... ngh, chu, haam... ngh..."
#Satoshi
"Mnh... A-Ai-san... I'm already..."
#Ai
"Not yet... please let me enjoy this a little longer..."
Ai-san bared the front of her clothes.
Her voluptuous breasts spilled out.
#Ai
"I can't compare to Mother, but I have a fair amount of confidence in them, you know?"
#Satoshi
"T-They're wonderful..."
My gaze was stolen by their overwhelming presence.
#Ai
"Ufu... what do you want to do...?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... well, that's... I'll leave it up to you, Ai-san..."
Flustered, I left everything in Ai-san's hands.
#Ai
"Is that so... even though you could do whatever you like..."
Ai-san murmured with a hint of disappointment, then took my hand and pressed it against her swelling breasts.
#Satoshi
"Whoa..."
My fingers stuck to them as if they were being sucked in.
#Ai
"Ufufu... there's no need to be so surprised."
#Satoshi
"B-But..."
#Ai
"Here... move your fingers slowly."
Just as she told me, I began to knead Ai-san's breasts.
#Ai
"Mnh... ah, like that... mnn, ha, ah..."
I could feel through my palm that the pink buds at the tips had grown hard.
#Ai
"Mmm... ha, ah... mnh..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san... are you feeling it too...?"
#Ai
"Y-Yes... because being touched by a man... it's my first time..."
Ai-san's cheeks flushed red.
#Satoshi
"Does that... mean you've done it with a woman before...?"
#Ai
"...I couldn't possibly say something like that..."
She lowered her face in embarrassment.
I was very curious, but it might be boorish to ask any further.
#Ai
"Ah... that's right. There was something I wanted to do for a man... would you cooperate with me?"
#Satoshi
"Eh, if it's something I can do as I am now..."
#Ai
"It won't be a problem. Not for you as you are now."
Ai-san said this as she gazed at my erect rod, then slid her body down toward my legs.
#Ai
"Ngh... how is it...?"
She sandwiched my penis between her breasts and looked up at me bashfully.
#Satoshi
"Whoa..."
At a sensation I had never experienced before, my hips pulled back instinctively.
#Ai
"Anh... you mustn't move yet... ngh..."
Ai-san let her saliva drip onto my penis and kneaded it with her breasts.
#Ai
"Hehe... it will move more easily like this, won't it?"
The saliva foamed and squelched, making my penis wet and slippery.
#Ai
"Now, if I just... move it like this, mnh..."
#Satoshi
"Ugh...!"
An unknown pressure began to crush my meat stick.
#Ai
"Mnh... how does it feel...?"
Ai-san smiled at me as she handled my rod with both breasts.
#Satoshi
"It... feels incredibly good..."
#Ai
"I see... then, more... mnh, ah, ngh..."
Ai-san moved her body.
#Ai
"Nnh... ngh, ha... mnh..."
My glans peeked in and out from the cleavage.
#Ai
"Mnh... ahh... ha, ngh... chu..."
Ai-san pressed her mouth to the tip of the glans.
#Ai
"Mnh... chu, mnh... mnh, ha, haah..."
#Satoshi
"Kuh..."
I tensed my buttocks, trying to endure the pleasure.
#Ai
"Mmm... mnh, ngh... ha, ah, mnh..."
Ai-san's body swayed as my rod was rubbed.
#Ai
"Mnh, ha, ah, mnh, t-this... feels so good..."
The feeling of ejaculation was gradually building.
#Satoshi
"Kuh... I'm about to go, Ai-san..."
#Ai
"Yes, it's okay... mnh, ha, ngh..."
Ai-san's movements grew more intense.
Cum inside
Cum on her face
#Ai
"Mnh, ha, ah, ngh, mnh... mnh, mnn!"
#Satoshi
"Kuh...!"
I released my seed between her breasts with all my might.
#Ai
"Ngh...! Ah, amazing... so much..."
While pressing her breasts against my twitching rod, Ai-san let out a joyful cry.
#Ai
"Anh... it's so sticky..."
She scooped up the dripping white fluid with her fingers and smeared it over her breasts.
#Ai
"Haah... so the real thing is this hot and thick..."
Ai-san murmured entrancedly.
#Ai
"Nnh, ah, ha, ah, mnh, mnh... mnh, mnn!"
#Satoshi
"Kuh...!"
I released my seed toward her face with all my might.
#Ai
"Nnh...! Ah, amazing... so hot..."
With her eyes closed, Ai-san received the semen on her face and let out a joyful cry.
#Ai
"Anh... so much came out..."
She scooped up the dripping white fluid with her fingers and smeared it over her breasts.
#Ai
"Haah... for so much to come out... the real thing really is different..."
Ai-san murmured entrancedly.
#Ai
"Mnh... of course you can still keep going, right...?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah... probably..."
#Ai
"If it's this hard... there shouldn't be a problem..."
Ai-san straddled me while stroking my penis.
#Ai
"Nnh, haa... aahh!"
My rod was inserted all the way to the base in one go.
#Ai
"Haa, aahh... it's hot... ngh..."
Her body trembled and twitched as she groaned.
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
#Ai
"Y-Yes... there's no problem. I was just... a bit surprised."
Ai-san let out the words with a shy smile.
#Ai
"Ngh... ah... t-this... I might get addicted to it..."
Ai-san murmured as she slowly rotated her hips.
#Satoshi
"...I think I'm going to get addicted too..."
Enveloped by her vagina, her body heat and vibrations were transmitted directly to me.
#Ai
"Mnh... does it feel that good...?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah... very... even when we're not moving, it feels good..."
#Ai
"Then... if we move, it'll feel even better..."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
For a short while, we gazed at each other in silence.
#Ai
"Mnh... w-what should we do...?"
#Satoshi
"Please... do whatever you like, Ai-san."
#Ai
"Th-Then... mnh..."
Ai-san slowly lifted her hips.
#Ai
"Nnh... ah, ha, aahh..."
My rod, wet with her love juices, was exposed to the air more than halfway before being swallowed back into her vagina.
#Ai
"Haa... ah, mnh... phew..."
Ai-san let out a long breath.
#Ai
"Mnh... ah... i-it's good..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
I moved my hips in time with her movements.
#Ai
"Haa, ah, nnh... th-that... ha, ah, i-it's good... nnh... haa, kuh...!"
Every time I thrust upward, her voluptuous breasts swayed heavily.
#Ai
"Ah, haa, mnh... ugh, mnh, ha, kuh... ngh...!"
Perhaps I was hitting a sensitive spot, as Ai-san was moving with her hips thrust forward.
#Ai
"Haa, ah, nnh, haa, mnh, mmm... ha, anh!"
Large drops of sweat scattered.
#Ai
"Mnh, ah, haa, m-more, mnh, kuh... ngh...!"
Ai-san placed her hands on my chest and moved her hips violently.
#Ai
"Haa, ah, ah, nnh, ha, kuh, ah, nnh...!"
#Satoshi
"Mnh... s-so suddenly..."
I hurriedly tensed my lower body.
If I didn't, it felt like the semen would leak out.
#Ai
"Nnh, b-because..."
Ai-san let out the words while shaking her hips.
#Ai
"Th-This... feels so good... I c-can't stop... nnh!"
The vaginal walls tightened with a squeeze.
#Ai
"Haa, ah, nnh, I'm g-going, I'm going, nnh, ah, ha, kuh... nnaahhh!!"
#Satoshi
"Ugh—!!"
#Ai
"Haa, ah, aahh... it's coming out... it's coming into me... nnh, ha, kuh... mnh..."
I reached my climax inside Ai-san.
My semen spurted out in bursts, being sucked into Ai-san's womb.
#Ai
"Haa, ah... ngh..."
Ai-san's body slumped over mine.
#Satoshi
"Whoa... Ai-san, are you okay...?"
#Ai
"Y-Yes... I've never felt anything like this before... it really is incredible..."
While breathing heavily, Ai-san whispered into my ear.
#Satoshi
"...I don't think it's because I'm incredible, you know?"
I replied while enjoying the sensation of her breasts pressed against me.
#Ai
"I think you're plenty incredible, you know? Though... I have nothing else to compare it to."
The eyes behind her glasses smiled a little bashfully.

I made my way down to the basement.
I’d already scouted out the fact that the power generation equipment was located here.
I attached a bypass wire to the fuse box to divert the current before prying the cover open.
Taking care not to shock myself, I replaced the internal fuse with one that had a much lower current rating.
I closed the lid and returned everything to how it was.
This should cause the fuse to melt and trigger a blackout right around the time electricity consumption peaks.
As I moved to leave the basement, I froze in front of the door.
There’s someone in the hall.
I didn’t have a second to waste.
Waiting for the moment they turned away, I slipped out from behind the door.
I delivered a single, heavy blow to the back of their head.
After confirming they were sprawled out on the floor, I quickly dashed up the stairs.
I shouldn't have been seen.
If I was seen, the entire plan falls apart.
I’ve already failed once, after all.
I entered her room.
She managed to survive once.
This will likely be the last chance.
The rest depends on how he decides to act.
He might be a bit more clever than I initially gave him credit for.

********************
The room was getting dark, so I switched on the light.
#Satoshi
"By the way, Ai-san, is your head alright after being hit?"
#Ai
"Yes, a bump formed, but please don't worry about it."
Ai-san smiled while lightly rubbing her head.
#Satoshi
"But I wonder why things turned out like this..."
#Ai
"Yes... you're right... I can only think that the wedding triggered something—"
Suddenly, the lights flickered and died.
#Ai
"Kyaa!?"
Ai-san let out a scream.
#Satoshi
"Is it a blackout...?"
My eyes, somewhat used to the dimness, scanned the room.
The light reflected off the snow outside was filtering through the window.
Between that and the glow from the fireplace, it wasn't pitch black.
I moved to the wall and flicked the light switch, but it didn't make a sound.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san—"
#Ai
"Nooo!!"
My voice was drowned out by Ai-san's shriek.
#Ai
"Hiee, no, stop, no..."
Ai-san was sobbing.
#Satoshi
"It's okay, Ai-san... I'm right here."
As I repeatedly offered her words of encouragement, her sobbing began to quiet down.
She seemed terribly frightened.
#Ai
"Wh... what happened...?"
#Satoshi
"I think it's just a simple power outage."
I said that just to put her at ease.
Deep down, I couldn't bring myself to believe it was that simple.
There was a high probability that the culprit was acting with some kind of intent.
I wanted to go and investigate, but—
I looked at Ai-san.
Even in the dim light, I could tell her face had gone pale.
What should I do... It might be a problem to leave her all alone in this room like this.
Take her to her own room.
Leave her in this room.
#Satoshi
"...Ai-san."
#Ai
"Y... yes...?"
#Satoshi
"I'm going to go investigate the cause of this blackout. But before that... I'll walk you back to your room."
#Ai
"Y-Yes..."
Ai-san nodded, still trembling.
I took Ai-san with me and stepped out into the hallway.
She was gripping the sleeve of my clothes tightly.
Nobody else had come out into the hallway yet.
I wondered if Dr. Mikanagi was in his room or the infirmary.
#Satoshi
"...Let's go."
I moved through the manor with Ai-san.
We arrived in front of Ai-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san, please go inside your room, lock the door, and stay put."
#Ai
"Yes... um, please be careful."
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
Ai-san bowed and went inside her room.
I heard the door lock.
...Good.
#Satoshi
"...Ai-san."
#Ai
"Y... yes...?"
#Satoshi
"I'm going to go investigate the cause of this blackout. So, I need you to stay in this room."
#Ai
"Eh... b-but..."
Ai-san's voice sounded lonely and anxious.
#Satoshi
"Being in this room is probably the safest thing for you. No matter who comes, if it's not me, don't ever open the door, okay?"
#Ai
"I... I understand."
Ai-san nodded.
#Satoshi
"Alright, I'm heading out. Make sure you lock the door."
#Ai
"Yes... um, please be careful."
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
I bowed to Ai-san and stepped out of the room.
Click—I heard the lock turn.
...Good.

--------------------
02a_1730F04.txt
********************
It looks like the entire building is indeed suffering from a blackout.
I should find someone and ask about the situation.

--------------------
02a_1800.txt
********************
It turned six o'clock, so I headed back to the hall for the time being.
The interior of the manor was as dark as ever.
It was getting to the point where walking around without a light would be difficult.
#Benio
"It's certainly gotten dark."
Benio-san was in the hall.
#Satoshi
"It really has..."
#Benio
"Are the preparations to fix the generator ready?"
In response to Benio-san's question, I showed her the toolbox I’d brought from the storage room.
#Satoshi
"Yes, I found the fuses, so I think it'll be fine. We need to get the lights back on as soon as possible, after all."
#Benio
"Are the preparations to fix the generator ready?"
#Satoshi
"Ah... w-well... I couldn't find the fuses."
#Benio
"...I see."
Benio-san held out a toolbox to me.
#Satoshi
"I-I'm sorry... but I'm not sure if I can actually do it..."
#Benio
"That reminds me, Tsujimura said he wanted to ask you to repair the generator."
#Satoshi
"Eh, me?"
#Benio
"I'm a complete amateur when it comes to machinery. Surely you can handle it?"
Saying so, Benio-san handed the toolbox over to me.
#Satoshi
"Umm, I'm not sure if I can, but..."
#Benio
"It's just replacing a fuse or something, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"...I'll do my best. I'm certainly starting to miss the light by now."
Even though it had only been about thirty minutes, it felt like a very long time.
#Benio
"If it stays dark even after night falls, the danger will only increase."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
Souko-san came down from the second floor.
#Souko
"Is it finally getting fixed?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, I have all the tools ready."
#Souko
"...Are you the one fixing it?"
Souko-san furrowed her brow.
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's the plan?"
#Souko
"Do you even know how to fix it?"
#Satoshi
"...Probably."
#Benio
"I haven't the slightest clue."
For some reason, Benio-san declared that with her chest puffed out.
#Souko
"...I'll go with you. I couldn't bear it if you ended up breaking it completely."
Souko-san let out a massive sigh.
We passed through the door at the bottom of the hall's stairs and headed down.
The basement was pitch black.
Our only reliance was the small beam from the flashlight illuminating the way ahead.
The light hit a large piece of machinery.
#Satoshi
"This is it."
#Souko
"First, check if the main power is turned off. Otherwise, you'll get electrocuted."
Having Souko-san point that out from behind me, I looked all over the machine.
I found a large lever.
The lever was flipped toward the side labeled "OFF."
#Souko
"It looks like it's already been shut off."
#Satoshi
"Then, all that's left... is to put this fuse in, right?"
#Souko
"The blown fuse should still be in there, so remove that first."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
I opened the white ceramic fuse box.
A fragment of a fuse that had been melted by heat was held in place by screws.
#Souko
"By the way... do you know what caused the blackout in the first place?"
Souko-san asked Benio-san.
#Benio
"Apparently, a fuse just blew. Tsujimura said that someone was likely using too much electricity somewhere."
#Souko
"I see..."
#Benio
"Fix it quickly. I can't stand this darkness."
#Satoshi
"I know. Now then—"
Using a screwdriver, I removed the fragments of the blown fuse.
I loosened the two screws at the top and bottom and fitted in a new fuse that was about the same thickness as the one that had blown.
#Benio
"...I'm impressed you can actually do something like that."
Benio-san was looking on with admiration.
#Souko
"It's a hassle to call an electrician for something like this, so I usually just do it myself."
#Benio
"We leave everything to Tsujimura, so I can't do a single thing around the house."
#Satoshi
"I think it's better if you can at least do a little bit, though."
Well, I suppose that helplessness is part of being a high-class lady.
I tightened the screws back up and closed the lid of the fuse box just as it was.
#Satoshi
"Now, if I just turn on the main power..."
I flipped the large lever toward "ON."
The lights came on.
Even though it shouldn't have been that bright, I squinted at the glare.
#Satoshi
"Eh—!?"
The lights immediately cut out again.
#Souko
"Again!?"
#Benio
"What happened!?"
Benio-san pressed closer.
#Satoshi
"Eh... what just happened...?"
Faltering, I shut off the main power once more.
Smoke was leaking from the white fuse box.
#Souko
"...Did it blow again...?"
I reached for the lid to check the fuse.
#Satoshi
"Hot!?"
#Souko
"Don't touch it carelessly when smoke is coming out. But... I wonder why."
Souko-san used the tip of the screwdriver to pry the lid open.
A thick cloud of smoke billowed out.
#Souko
"Wait, could it be..."
Souko-san picked up the fragment of the fuse that had been there before.
#Souko
"You put in one that was the same size as this, right?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's right..."
#Souko
"I suspect... including the one that was blown before, they might have been replaced with fuses that have a low ampere rating."
#Benio
"What does that mean?"
#Souko
"It means they'll blow again right away."
#Benio
"I don't quite get it, but isn't there a bigger one?"
#Satoshi
"Umm..."
I looked for a spare fuse.
There was only one that was thicker than the previous one.
#Satoshi
"Ah, I found it. But... what's going on?"
#Souko
"It's likely the work of the culprit. They probably replaced the fuses with ones that are right on the edge of the daytime power consumption, intending for them to blow in the evening when more electricity is used."
#Satoshi
"So you're saying it was a trap. But... what could the culprit's intention be?"
#Souko
"Well... giving everyone around them a sense of anxiety by having the lights go out, or simply making it easier for themselves to move around, I suppose."
#Benio
"In other words, there's a possibility they're on the move right at this moment."
#Souko
"...That might be the case."
#Benio
"I don't quite understand, but is this kind of thing easy to do?"
#Souko
"It wouldn't be difficult for someone with a certain amount of knowledge."
#Benio
"Hmm..."
Benio-san crossed her arms and sank into thought.
#Benio
"...So, since the power just cut out again, does that mean a lot of electricity is still being used somewhere?"
#Souko
"That...!"
Souko-san gasped and grabbed my arm.
I was just about to install the larger fuse and flip the main power switch.
#Satoshi
"Eh...!?"
#Souko
"Wait. There's a possibility of a short circuit somewhere. If we don't investigate that first, the line might just snap again."
#Satoshi
"A short circuit... you mean. Where on earth...?"
#Souko
"I don't know... but let's split up and look for it."
#Satoshi
"But how...?"
#Souko
"A wire might have been chewed on by a rat... or maybe water. If meltwater from the snow is leaking into the attic..."
#Benio
"If it comes to that, we amateurs are helpless... Hmm? Water... how about the bathroom? If it's related to plumbing, that's about the only place I can think of."
#Satoshi
"Anyway, let's go check. It's also necessary to confirm everyone else's safety."
#Souko
"...You're right."
#Benio
"We can finally settle down now."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... but why a blackout at a time like this..."
#Souko
"...It's possible it was a trap set by the culprit."
#Benio
"Mm, I agree."
The two of them looked at each other and nodded.
#Satoshi
"A trap, huh..."
#Souko
"Let's head back for now. It's hard to settle down in such a cramped place."
#Benio
"Once we're back, let's make sure to confirm that everyone is safe."
#Satoshi
"Right."

--------------------
02a_1830.txt
********************
By the time we returned to the hall, a crowd had gathered.
#Takamine
"What happened?"
Takamine-san asked.
#Souko
"Yes... it seems the generator was tampered with."
#Mikanagi
"Whatever for...?"
#Benio
"Doctor, first we're going to confirm everyone's safety."
Benio-san cut Dr. Mikanagi off and spoke up.
#Benio
"Lawyer Takamine and the Doctor are here. Where are Mother and the others?"
#Mikanagi
"Maya-san is in the drawing room. Narumi-san and Akane-san are there as well."
#Benio
"...Where are my sister and Shion?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, Ai-san is in my room."
#Benio
"Why in your room... well, fine. Go check on her immediately."
#Satoshi
"Yes, understood."
Feeling the weight of Benio-san's suspicious gaze, I turned on my heel and headed up the stairs.

--------------------
02a_1840.txt
********************
I returned to the front of my room.
I knocked on the door.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san, it's me. Please open up."
...That's strange.
There was no response from inside.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san...?"
I twisted the doorknob, but it was firmly locked.
With trembling hands, I took out my key and inserted it into the keyhole.
The moment I entered the room, the first thing I saw was Ai-san collapsed facedown on the bed.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san!?"
I rushed over in a panic and shook her.
#Ai
"Mnh..."
#Satoshi
"Sh-She's alive...?"
Seeing her stir slightly, I let out a sigh of relief.
Ai-san opened her eyes.
I could see a faint trace of tears at the corners of her eyes.
#Ai
"Ah..."
#Satoshi
"Eh—!?"
Suddenly, Ai-san lunged forward and hugged me.
#Ai
"Uuugh... thank goodness... mnh, ugh... uuuugh..."
Ai-san clung to me and sobbed.
#Ai
"Ugh... uuuugh... mnh, ugh..."
#Satoshi
"...It's okay, Ai-san..."
I comforted her while stroking her head.
#Ai
"I was... so scared, dark places... I've never been able to handle them... ngh... uuuugh..."
#Satoshi
"It's okay now... just calm down."
I continued to soothe the wailing Ai-san.

--------------------
02a_1855.txt
********************
After Ai-san finally calmed down, I took her out of the room.
We arrived in front of Ai-san's room.
#Satoshi
"I think it's fine now, but please try to stay in your room as much as possible, okay?"
#Ai
"Okay..."
Ai-san placed her hand on her door.
#Ai
"...Thank you so much, truly."
With a bow, she disappeared inside her room.
#Satoshi
"Now then—"
The only one whose safety I haven't confirmed is Shion-san, I suppose.
Nobody seems to be making a fuss, so she's likely fine, but I'll go make sure just in case.

--------------------
02a_1900.txt
********************
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
When I entered the office, Tsujimura-san was sitting in a chair, staring blankly into space.
#Satoshi
"Um... Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"A-Ah... it was you. Is something the matter?"
Tsujimura-san immediately straightened his posture and asked.
#Satoshi
"I just thought I'd go check on Shion-san as well. ...Did something happen, Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"No... so many things have happened that my mind is feeling a bit cluttered."
#Satoshi
"That... goes for me too. I think everyone is feeling that way."
#Tsujimura
"...My apologies. For things to turn out like this..."
#Satoshi
"It's not your fault, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"However... with Mr. Rokuyou murdered and Miss Ai attacked... as the one responsible for managing this manor, I feel terribly sorry..."
Tsujimura-san looked down.
He looked so small.
#Tsujimura
"...In the past, something similar happened."
#Satoshi
"Something similar...!?"
#Tsujimura
"No, naturally nobody died. However... because of my own incompetence, I once caused a great deal of trouble for the Madam and the others..."
At Tsujimura-san's confession, I felt a slight sense of relief.
I couldn't bear it if things like this happened all the time.
#Tsujimura
"Even now, I find myself thinking about it. I wonder if there was something more I could have done back then. It might be far too late for regrets now, though."
#Satoshi
"Tsujimura-san..."
#Tsujimura
"I'm begging you. Even if it's only while you're here... could you please protect the young lady, Shion-ojousama...?"
#Satoshi
"Well... of course. I want to protect everyone."
#Tsujimura
"Ah... thank you very much."
Tsujimura-san bowed deeply.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san is safe, isn't she?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, of course. She is in her own room right now."
#Satoshi
"I'll go check on her for a bit."
#Tsujimura
"Understood. I'm counting on you."

--------------------
02a_1930.txt
********************
When I stepped out of the office, the fierce blizzard was as intense as ever.
A faint trail of small footprints continued toward the tower.
Those are likely Shion-san's footprints.
I stepped into the tower.
Shion-san is on the second floor.
I went up the stairs and knocked on the door.
#Shion
"Yes...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
After I spoke, the door opened from the inside a moment later.
#Shion
"Um... is something the matter...?"
Shion-san's eyes were moist.
I wonder if she’d been crying...
#Satoshi
"I came to make sure that everyone is alright."
#Shion
"...I see."
Shion-san looked down.
#Satoshi
"Umm... so—"
#Shion
"Please, come in..."
Shion-san opened the door and invited me inside.
#Satoshi
"Ah... excuse me."
#Shion
"...Did you come here to watch me?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... no, that's not it at all?"
#Shion
"Then... why...?"
#Satoshi
"...Because I'm worried about you, Shion-san."
I voiced my honest feelings.
#Satoshi
"It's partly because Tsujimura-san asked me to... but I can't just leave you be. Not someone living all alone in a place this far removed."
#Satoshi
"Besides... Ai-san was attacked around midday. You might be a target for the culprit too, Shion-san."
#Shion
"But, I..."
#Satoshi
"I'll definitely find the culprit. So... until then, I'll make sure to protect you, Shion-san."
Shion-san stayed silent and looked down.
#Satoshi
"Um... was I being a nuisance, perhaps...?"
#Shion
"...No, that's... not the case."
Shion-san shook her head.
#Satoshi
"Umm... sorry, I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself..."
#Shion
"No... th-thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"W-Well then, I'll be going..."
In that awkward atmosphere, I bowed and left Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"...Shion-san, could I ask you for just one thing?"
#Shion
"What is it...?"
#Satoshi
"...I'd like to hear that song from last night one more time."
#Shion
"Eh...?"
Shion-san's eyes widened in surprise.
And for good reason.
Anyone would be surprised if they were suddenly asked something like that.
#Shion
"My song...?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah... if you don't mind..."
#Shion
"...My apologies. Right now, I'm just not... in the mood for that..."
#Satoshi
"...You're right. Sorry, I shouldn't have asked such a strange thing..."
#Shion
"No..."
#Shion
"...Alright."
Shion-san nodded and steadied her breathing.
With just that, the air in the room grew tense and still.
After she finished singing, Shion-san bowed to me.
#Shion
"Um... was that alright...?"
#Satoshi
"Ah... thank you very much. It really... touched my heart."
#Shion
"Not at all..."
#Satoshi
"What kind of song is that?"
#Shion
"...I don't know."
Shion-san shook her head.
#Shion
"But... when I sing this song, I feel very calm."
#Satoshi
"It was a very good song."
#Shion
"Th-Thank you very much..."
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going. Please let me hear it again sometime."
I offered my thanks to Shion-san and left her room.

--------------------
02a_2000.txt
********************
When I went up to the second floor, I suddenly found myself wondering about Souko-san.
Considering everything that’s coming, maybe I should talk to her for a bit...
I arrived in front of Souko-san's room.
I knocked on the door and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
I didn't think she'd have gone to bed already...
Without thinking, I reached for the doorknob.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
It wasn't locked.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san...?"
I peeked inside the room.
—She was there.
She was sitting by the window, looking down.
She didn't even try to look up; I wonder if she didn't even notice me knocking on the door.
#Satoshi
"—Souko-san."
#Souko
"Eh... ah, it's you..."
Souko-san looked up as if startled.
#Satoshi
"You shouldn't leave your door unlocked... it's careless."
#Souko
"...It wasn't locked?"
#Satoshi
"No... are you alright?"
#Souko
"...I suppose even I'm getting quite worn down."
Souko-san let out a deep sigh.
#Satoshi
"It's only natural."
I'm pretty exhausted myself.
#Satoshi
"After all... we still don't know who killed Rokuyou-san..."
#Souko
"It's not your fault alone."
#Satoshi
"But..."
#Souko
"...You're doing well, even in such an abnormal situation."
#Satoshi
"That's... only because I want to be of help to you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"To me...?"
Souko-san blinked in surprise.
#Satoshi
"...Yes. You've always been someone I admired. That's why I followed you this far, and from here on too..."
#Souko
"...I see. Thank you."
Souko-san smiled.
#Satoshi
"Um... I'll protect you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Protect me...?"
#Satoshi
"...Yes. No matter what happens, I'll definitely protect you to the very end."
#Souko
"Hehe... you're quite cheeky for someone younger than me."
—Then.
Souko-san lunged forward and hugged me.
Involuntarily, I caught her body in my arms.
#Souko
"...And just how do you plan to protect me?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know. But—I want to protect you."
#Souko
"...You talk as if we're the ones being targeted."
#Satoshi
"...There's no guarantee that we're safe, after all."
#Souko
"I suppose that's true..."
Souko-san tightened her grip.
#Souko
"Hey... can we stay like this for a little longer...?"
#Satoshi
"...Of course."
I tightened my grip as well.
I could feel Souko-san's warmth.
#Satoshi
"I'll stay like this for as long as you want."
#Souko
"Hehe... you really are cheeky..."
I wonder how much time passed just like that.
#Souko
"...Thank you."
Souko-san whispered in a small voice and gently pulled away from me.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"I'm alright now. You have other things you need to do, don't you?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Souko
"You have to investigate what's happening in this manor. I'll cooperate too, so let's do our best."
#Satoshi
"...Yeah. I know."
#Souko
"First, we have to make sure there aren't any more victims."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
Yeah.
That's right.
I have to focus on that right now.
I don't know when we'll be able to leave this snow-bound manor, but until then, we have to endure.
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll... go and make the rounds."
#Souko
"Yes. ...Be careful, okay?"
Souko-san's lips were right in front of me.
Without hesitation, I pressed my lips against hers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
02a_2000h.txt
********************
#Souko
"Ngh... mnn..."
Souko-san's eyes widened for a split second in surprise, but she accepted me immediately.
#Souko
"Mmm... nnh, haa... ah..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"Mmh... what is it?"
#Satoshi
"I... with you, Souko-san—"
The words wouldn't come after that.
#Souko
"Ngh..."
Souko-san sealed my lips.
#Souko
"Mmh, chu... nnh, ngh... ngh..."
Souko-san's tongue invaded my mouth.
#Souko
"Nnh... nnh, ha... mnn..."
She moved her tongue as if to entwine mine within hers.
#Souko
"Ngh... nnh, haa, ha... haam..."
Our saliva mingled together.
#Souko
"Mnh... ngh, haah..."
Souko-san pulled her lips away.
A thread of saliva stretched between us, forming a bridge.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"...Don't say it."
#Satoshi
"But why...?"
#Souko
"...There are some feelings that are conveyed better when left unsaid."
She whispered that and pressed her lips against mine again.
#Souko
"Mmh... ngh, haam... mnn..."
Souko-san's tongue licked against my teeth.
#Souko
"Haa... ah, nnh... chu, haam..."
Responding to her, I caressed the inside of her mouth with my tongue.
#Souko
"Nnh... haa, haah..."
Souko-san pressed her body against mine.
She smelled wonderful.
I gently touched her through her clothes.
#Souko
"Mmh... ah..."
A hot sigh escaped Souko-san's mouth.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
I began to undo the buttons of her clothes.
#Souko
"Nnh..."
I touched Souko-san's bare, feverish skin.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, nnh... ngh, ngh..."
Souko-san's body gave a little twitch.
#Souko
"Nnh, ah... your hands feel so cool..."
#Satoshi
"...Your body is getting really hot, Souko-san."
#Souko
"That's because... nnh, chu..."
As if to hide her embarrassment, Souko-san clung to my lips.
#Souko
"Mmh, nnh, chu... mmm... haam, chu..."
Souko-san's breasts, held within my hands, were lightly dampened with sweat.
#Souko
"Mnh... ah, ha... ngh... mnh, ngh... chu, haam..."
While we exchanged kisses, I savored the sensation of her breasts.
#Souko
"Haa... ah, nnh, mmm..."
The small buds caught between my fingers grew hard and sharp, as if asserting their presence.
#Souko
"Haa... ah, nnh... th-there... anh..."
Souko-san writhed and pressed her body against mine.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, nnh, haa, haah..."
I pinched her erect nipples and gave them a light tug.
#Souko
"Nnh... ah, ha, th-that... nnh, ha, ugh..."
Her body twitched and trembled as she gasped.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, mmh... nnh, chu..."
I responded to Souko-san's kiss by putting my tongue out.
#Souko
"Nnh... ha, ahh..."
Souko-san wrapped her legs around mine.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
I slid my hand toward her lower abdomen.
#Souko
"Ngh... ha, ah..."
Just touching her through her underwear made me think I heard a squelching sound.
#Souko
"Hey... touch me... directly..."
Souko-san whispered into my ear.
#Souko
"Nnh... ha, ah...!"
That part of her easily swallowed my finger.
#Souko
"Ah, ahh, nnh, ha, ugh...!"
Hot love juices clung to my finger.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, ngh... mnh, ha, kuh... mnh..."
With just a slight movement of my fingertip, Souko-san twisted her body and let out a pained moan.
#Souko
"Ah, nnh, haa... ah, nnh... ngh, kuh..."
I continued to stir up the love juices that welled out one after another.
#Souko
"Nnh, ha, kuh... mnh, ah, ahh, ha, nnh...!"
Souko-san's hands grabbed my arm.
#Souko
"W-Wait... a little slower... ngh..."
#Satoshi
"Is it too much...?"
#Souko
"N-No, that's not it... your hand just feels too good..."
#Satoshi
"I-Is that so..."
I feel... pretty good about myself.
I'm the one making Souko-san feel this way.
Thinking that made me want to make her feel even better.
#Souko
"Nnh, ha, ah! S-So... w-wait..."
When I added a second finger and began to churn inside her, Souko-san couldn't help but grab hold of me.
#Souko
"Ha, haah... nnh, ngh... y-you really are something..."
#Satoshi
"...Seeing you pleasured like this makes me happy too, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Even so... nnh, jeez..."
After letting out a sigh, Souko-san entrusted her body to me.
#Souko
"...I can't push you away when you say something like that."
#Satoshi
"...Then, shall I continue?"
#Souko
"Alright... keep going."
I placed my finger against the clitoris peeking out from her folds.
#Souko
"Nnh... ha, ah, ngh..."
Souko-san's body gave a little twitch.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, there... nnh, ha, kuh... mnh..."
#Satoshi
"Does it feel good... here...?"
#Souko
"Mnh... y-yes, so... more... nnh...!?"
I flicked my fingertip against her clitoris as if rubbing it.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, nnh...!! Th-That... nnh, ngh, kuuh...!"
I repeatedly caressed her there.
#Souko
"No, ah, nnh! Haa, ah, hah, ngh! No, ah, ahh, nnh, ha, i-it's coming, ngh!!"
Along with Souko-san's voice, her love juices sprayed out with force.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, aahh... nnh, kuh..."
Her body trembled violently as she leaned against me.
#Souko
"Haa, haa, haah..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"How... pathetic, for you to... make me go like that... nnh..."
While letting out several ragged breaths, Souko-san managed to speak.
#Souko
"Hey... you... want to go too, don't you...?"
Souko-san reached her hand toward my pants.
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah... well..."
My member was already swollen to its limit, feeling cramped inside my pants.
#Souko
"Hehe... then, this time... let me do it."
Souko-san pulled my pants down.
#Souko
"Ngh..."
She took my meat stick into her mouth all the way to the base in one go.
#Souko
"Mmm, ngh... ngh... i-it's big..."
#Satoshi
"I wouldn't... know about that..."
#Souko
"Hehe... mmh, ngh... nnh, ngh, chu..."
Souko-san gave a small smile and put her mouth on me.
#Souko
"Haam, nnh... nnh, ngh... nnh, haa... mmm..."
She painstakingly coated my rod with saliva.
#Souko
"Mmm... chu, chupa, ngh..."
My penis glistened wetly and grew even harder.
#Souko
"Nnh, nnh... ngh, haa, haam... mnh..."
Her tongue traced the underside and the rim of the glans.
#Satoshi
"Ugh..."
#Souko
"Hehe... mnh, ngh... ngh, ha, hah... mnh..."
Sensing that my moan was because it felt good, Souko-san teased me even more with the tip of her tongue.
#Souko
"Nnh, chu, mmh... how is it... does it feel good...?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes, it's... very good."
#Souko
"I see... then, I'll do even more for you..."
Souko-san's tongue flicked against my urethral opening.
#Souko
"Mmn... nnh, ngh... mnh, kuh... mmh, nnh..."
Souko-san's movements gradually grew faster.
#Souko
"Nnh, chu, mmh, haam, ngh, mnh..."
The saliva made a squelching sound.
#Souko
"Nnh, nnh, ngh, kuh, ngh, nnh, chu, ngh..."
#Satoshi
"Ugh... S-Souko-san..."
The pleasure shot up my spine.
#Souko
"Ngh, nnh, ngh, chu, mmh, nnh, nnh..."
#Satoshi
"Kuh... I'm about to go..."
Cum in her mouth
Cum on her face
I placed my hands on Souko-san's head and moved my hips back and forth.
#Souko
"Nnh, ngh, ngh, mmh, nnh, nnh, ngh...!"
#Satoshi
"It's coming...!!"
#Souko
"Mph...!? Nnh, ngh... nnh, ngh..."
I burst my seed into Souko-san's mouth.
#Souko
"Nnh... kuh, cough, cough..."
Semen dripped from the corner of Souko-san's mouth.
#Satoshi
"S-Sorry, Souko-san..."
#Souko
"...Quite a lot came out... I can't even drink it all..."
#Satoshi
"You... you don't have to force yourself to do that..."
#Souko
"Hehe... this thing just... puts me in the mood for it..."
Saying so, Souko-san swallowed the remaining semen in her mouth.
I placed my hands on Souko-san's head and moved my hips back and forth.
#Souko
"Nnh, ngh, ngh, mmh, nnh, nnh, ngh...!"
#Satoshi
"It's coming...!!"
#Souko
"Haa...!? Ah, nnh... nnh, ngh..."
I sprayed my cloud-white semen onto Souko-san's face.
#Souko
"Haa... nnh, haa, aahh..."
Souko-san's face was covered in the white liquid.
#Satoshi
"S-Sorry, Souko-san..."
#Souko
"...Quite a lot came out..."
#Satoshi
"Well... it's not like I could help it."
#Souko
"And why is that...?"
#Satoshi
"Because... you were the one doing it, Souko-san..."
#Souko
"Hehe... thank you."
Saying so, Souko-san scooped up some semen from her cheek with her finger and licked it.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san... I'm not... done yet..."
My member showed no sign of flagging, standing tall and pointing toward the ceiling.
#Souko
"Yes... that's fine."
I gently reached for Souko-san's clothes.
#Souko
"—Wait. Leave my clothes... as they are."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san...?"
#Souko
"I don't really... want you to see."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
I didn't do anything else and gently laid her body down on the bed.
#Satoshi
"Well then... here I go."
I pressed my still-swollen rod against her drenched vaginal opening.
#Souko
"Ngh... mnn...!"
Souko-san furrowed her brow as she accepted me.
#Souko
"Haa... ah, ngh..."
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
#Souko
"Yes... don't worry."
Souko-san gave a smile.
She felt so hot inside, her walls squeezing tightly around me.
#Souko
"Nnh... ngh, ha, ah..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san... can I move...?"
#Souko
"Yes... of course."
Souko-san's hands grabbed my arms.
#Souko
"You can do whatever you like..."
With those words, the blood rushed even more to my lower body.
#Souko
"Nnh, ah... you're so energetic... mnh, ngh, kuh... ngh..."
I began to move my hips back and forth, bit by bit.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, nnh, haa... anh, nnh, ngh, kuuh... nnh..."
Every time the rim of my glans rubbed against her walls, Souko-san let out a voice and twisted her body.
#Souko
"Haa, nnh, kuh, ngh, nnh, ha, ah... nnh!"
#Satoshi
"Ugh... S-Souko-san..."
I held Souko-san tight.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, nnh, ngh... ha, ah, ah, ngh!"
Souko-san wrapped her arms around me as well.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, nnh! Kuh, nnh, ha, augh!"
I repeated my thrusts.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, ah, ahh! Nnh, ngh, kuh, ugh, ngh!"
Her walls tightened every time Souko-san let out a voice.
#Souko
"Haa, ah, nnh... ah, ha, nnh..."
When I slowed my pace, Souko-san let out a long breath.
#Souko
"Haa... ah... too intense... ngh..."
#Satoshi
"S-Sorry..."
#Souko
"I-It's alright, but go a little easier on me..."
With a wry smile, Souko-san gave my forehead a little flick.
#Souko
"Hey... be gentle with me?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes..."
Just as Souko-san told me, I slowly pulled my hips back.
#Souko
"Nnh... mnn... yes, like that... it's good..."
Souko-san arched her back.
#Souko
"Haa... aahh, nnh, haah..."
#Satoshi
"Is this... alright?"
#Souko
"Nnh... yes, gradually... go faster... nnh, ha, ungh..."
Souko-san's hands grabbed my arms.
#Souko
"Ha, nnh, ngh, nnh, ah, nnh, ngh..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san... I'm about to..."
#Souko
"Mnh, y-yes, it's okay... come whenever you're ready... mnh, ah, ha... nnh... ngh, kuuh... nnh!"
I tensed my lower body and shook my hips.
#Souko
"Haa! Ah, nnh! Nnh, kuh, haa, ah, nnaahhh!!"
#Satoshi
"Kuh—it's coming!"
Cum inside
Cum outside
#Souko
"Nnh...! Haa, ah, it's coming... nnh, ah, aahh..."
Souko-san managed to speak while her body trembled.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, ngh... ngh, haah..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
I clung to her, staying just as I was after climaxing inside Souko-san's vagina.
#Souko
"What is it...?"
#Satoshi
"I'll protect you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"...I see."
With a small nod, Souko-san held me tight as well.
#Souko
"Nnh...! Haa, ah, it's coming... nnh, ah, aahh..."
Souko-san managed to speak while her body trembled.
#Souko
"Ha, ah, ngh... ngh, haah... haa... quite a lot came out..."
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
I clung to Souko-san.
#Souko
"Nnh... what is it...?"
#Satoshi
"I'll protect you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"...I see."
With a small nod, Souko-san held me tight as well.
Souko-san wiped away the scattered body fluids and fixed her disheveled clothes.
#Souko
"...What are you going to do now?"
#Satoshi
"Well... I want to make sure there are no more victims."
#Souko
"Yes, you're right... since Ai-san was attacked as well, it wouldn't be strange no matter who's being targeted."
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll... go and make the rounds."
#Souko
"Yes. ...Be careful."

********************
It happened when I arrived at the north hallway on my way back to my room.
#Satoshi
"Hmm...?"
Someone went into the study at the back.
I wonder who it is at this hour...?
I quietly approached the study, but the door was tightly closed and I couldn't see what was happening inside.
I guess I'll just have to wait for them to come out.
I went back to my room and decided to watch the study by leaving my door slightly open.
About twenty minutes must have passed just like that.
The door to the study opened.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
The person who emerged from the study was Akane-san.
She was looking around the hallway carefully, appearing restless.
Fortunately, she didn't seem to have noticed me watching her.
I wonder what she was doing...
I doubt it's—but maybe I should check.
I stepped into the hallway and spoke to Akane-san.
#Satoshi
"—Akane-san."
#Akane
"Hyaah!?"
Akane-san literally jumped.
#Akane
"A-Ah, ugh... i-it was you..."
#Satoshi
"A-Are you alright...?"
I reached out to Akane-san, who had collapsed onto the floor.
#Akane
"Th-Thank you very much..."
Akane-san stood up unsteadily.
#Satoshi
"Ah, you dropped something."
I picked up a scrap of cloth that had fallen to the floor.
Is it a handkerchief?
The name "Akari·M" was embroidered on the edge.
#Satoshi
"Akari...?"
#Akane
"Ah, s-sorry!"
As if snatching it away, Akane-san grabbed the handkerchief from my hand.
#Satoshi
"That... is yours, right, Akane-san?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes. I m-made a mistake when I was sewing the name..."
Akane-san spoke incoherently.
If she says so, then maybe that's it... but her panic seemed very strange for that.
#Akane
"Th-Thank you! Well then!"
With a bow, Akane-san immediately hurried away down the hallway.
But what was she doing in the study?
Given Akane-san's job, it wouldn't be unusual for her to enter and exit rooms in the manor.
However, it's not exactly time for cleaning at this hour.
I moved back to the front of the study.
I reached for the doorknob, but it was locked after all.
What was she doing here...?
Maybe... it has something to do with the things that have been happening...
A door opened behind me.
#Satoshi
"Eh... Dr. Mikanagi?"
When I turned around, Dr. Mikanagi had emerged from his room.
#Mikanagi
"Was that... Akane-san just now?"
#Satoshi
"Yes... she seemed to be doing something..."
#Mikanagi
"I knew it..."
Dr. Mikanagi let out a sigh.
#Satoshi
"Um, Dr. Mikanagi... Akane-san is..."
#Mikanagi
"—Let's talk in my room."
Dr. Mikanagi opened his door wide.
#Satoshi
"...Excuse me."

--------------------
02a_2130.txt
********************
#Mikanagi
"—It's been like that for a while now."
Once the door was closed, Dr. Mikanagi began to talk.
#Satoshi
"...You mean Akane-san, right?"
#Mikanagi
"Yeah. ...Occasionally, she seems to be doing something in the study."
#Satoshi
"What is she doing?"
At my question, Dr. Mikanagi shook his head.
#Mikanagi
"I don't know. I've never questioned her directly, and I don't think anyone else knows besides me."
#Satoshi
"...Does it have anything to do with this case, perhaps...?"
#Mikanagi
"I don't think so. Her behavior has been going on since before this, and... I don't really think she's doing anything bad."
#Satoshi
"...? What do you mean?"
#Mikanagi
"I haven't heard of anything going missing, either. I suspect she's researching something, but..."
#Satoshi
"What on earth could she be..."
#Mikanagi
"I don't know. I should have told her to stop before someone else found her, though..."
Dr. Mikanagi let out another sigh.
#Satoshi
"...On the handkerchief Akane-san dropped earlier, there was 'Akari·M' embroidered on it."
#Mikanagi
"Akari...?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah. Akane-san said she made a mistake when she was doing the embroidery, but..."
#Mikanagi
"...I suppose that sort of thing happens."
Dr. Mikanagi murmured.
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
In any case, I might need to keep a close eye on Akane-san.
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going now."
Thinking I'd head back to my room to gather my thoughts, I stood up.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, it'll be faster if you go this way."
Saying so, Dr. Mikanagi pointed to the door near the window.
#Mikanagi
"Your room is right next door, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
It's a door that connects the rooms directly.
It's certainly close, but...
I walked up to the door and twisted the knob.
It was locked.
#Mikanagi
"The doors between rooms are special; this one can only be opened with your key."
Dr. Mikanagi took out the key to his room and inserted it into the keyhole.
#Mikanagi
"See, my key can't open it. Give yours a try."
#Satoshi
"Okay..."
I inserted the key to my room.
The door opened.
#Mikanagi
"It can only be opened with a key from one side. So, I'm praying that you aren't the culprit."
#Satoshi
"...Of course I'm not."
I can understand being wary of people who can open this door, so I gave a simple nod.
#Satoshi
"Well then, good night."
#Mikanagi
"Yeah, good night."

--------------------
02a_2200.txt
********************
I returned to my room and closed the door.
#Satoshi
"Phew..."
I flopped down onto the bed.
I'm definitely tired today.
I wonder why so many different things have to happen in a single day.
It was only this morning that Rokuyou-san was killed.
It feels like such a long time ago.
That doesn't mean the impression has faded, though; that headless body is clearly burned into my mind.
It's as if—everything started happening because I came here.
There's no way that's true, of course.
This series of disturbances... is Mr. Kousei Nanatsuki's inheritance involved after all?
If that's the case, then Benio-san and Maya-san might be targets as well.
And Shion-san too, of course.
And there's a high probability that Ai-san will be targeted again.
But... if that's the case, then who on earth is the culprit?
To prevent any further casualties, it might be best to narrow down the target to some extent...
Should I focus on staying with someone, or should I keep watch over the manor as a whole...?
Focus on being on guard with someone.
Watch over the manor as a whole.
Maybe I should take a gamble.
In that case, who should I go to...?
I'll stay with Souko-san.
She has nothing to do with the inheritance, but I can't say for certain that there's zero chance of her being targeted.
I decided to head to Souko-san's room.
The one most likely to be targeted next is Benio-san, I suppose.
I decided to head to Benio-san's room.
The one most likely to be targeted next is Shion-san, I suppose.
I decided to head to the tower where Shion-san is.
Maybe Maya-san will be targeted.
I decided to head to Maya-san's room.
There's even a chance Ai-san will be targeted again.
I decided to head to Ai-san's room.
There's a good chance Tsujimura-san will be targeted too.
I decided to head to Tsujimura-san's place.
Maybe Takamine-san will be targeted.
I decided to head to Takamine-san's room.
Maybe Dr. Mikanagi is in danger.
He has nothing to do with the inheritance, but I can't say for certain that there's zero chance of him being targeted.
I decided to go to Dr. Mikanagi's room.
Maybe Akane-san will be a victim.
She has nothing to do with the inheritance, but I can't say for certain that there's zero chance of her being targeted.
I decided to go to Akane-san's place.
Narumi-san might be a victim too.
She has nothing to do with the inheritance, but I can't say for certain that there's zero chance of her being targeted.
I decided to go to Narumi-san's place.
It won't do to stay in one place.
My opponent is a human too.
They might intentionally avoid where I am and target someone else.
I should probably patrol the manor through the night.
I decided to leave the room.

--------------------
02a_2210ai.txt
********************
I arrived in front of Ai-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Ai-san emerged.
#Ai
"Oh... did something happen?"
#Satoshi
"Umm... it hasn't been confirmed that you're safe yet, so I thought I'd try to protect you somehow."
#Ai
"Eh...?"
#Satoshi
"Um... I'll stay in this room tonight to protect you."
#Ai
"That's... um, I'm happy you'd offer, but..."
Ai-san seems troubled.
#Ai
"Well... Mother is right next door, and so is Benio..."
#Satoshi
"No, no! I didn't come here with any illicit intentions!"
I waved my hands in front of me to deny it.
#Satoshi
"I just wanted to protect you, Ai-san..."
#Ai
"I... thank you very much for that. But... well, spending the night in the same room is a bit..."
#Satoshi
"Then I could stay in the hallway—"
#Ai
"No. You'll catch a cold. I'll stay in my room with the door locked, so please get some rest in your own room too."
#Satoshi
"I see... but please make sure not to let your guard down."
#Ai
"Yes, I know. Thank you."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210aka.txt
********************
I arrived in front of Akane-san's room on the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Akane-san, it's me. Are you there?"
I called out and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
I wonder if she's not there, or if she's already asleep—
Just as I gave up and turned around.
#Akane
"Oh? Did something happen?"
I heard Akane-san's voice from behind me.
#Satoshi
"Ah... Akane-san, were you in the dining room?"
#Akane
"Yes. I still have some work to do. ...By the way, what can I do for you?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, there might be danger again tonight, so I thought I'd protect you through the night."
#Akane
"Eh... eeehh!?"
Akane-san let out a cry of surprise and took a few steps back.
#Akane
"No, um, even if you say that so suddenly, I'm not mentally prepared...!"
#Satoshi
"No, no! It's not anything strange like that, so please don't misunderstand!"
#Akane
"B-But, well... that's what you mean, right...?"
#Satoshi
"What on earth do you mean...?"
#Akane
"Jeez... please don't trouble your big sister so much."
Akane-san placed her hands on her hips and pouted.
#Satoshi
"...Well, I might be younger than you, but."
#Akane
"I still have work to do, and Narumi-san is nearby, so there's no need to worry. Please get some rest, guest."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210may.txt
********************
I arrived in front of Maya-san's room at the far end of the west side of the second floor.
#Satoshi
"Maya-san, are you awake?"
The door opened, and Maya-san peeked her face out.
#Maya
"Oh... what brings you here at this hour?"
#Satoshi
"I thought I'd protect you here tonight, Maya-san."
#Maya
"Oh my..."
#Satoshi
"The one most likely to be targeted next is you, Maya-san. I want to prevent any further casualties somehow."
#Maya
"But... I can't let a guest do such a thing."
#Satoshi
"But I want to prevent any further victims from appearing."
#Maya
"Hehe... thank you. But there's no need for worry. Besides... I can't let a gentleman stay in my room."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right, of course..."
#Maya
"I'll make sure to lock the door and rest tonight. Thank you very much for your advice."
#Satoshi
"No... I'm the one who should apologize for saying such a strange thing."
#Maya
"Well then, good night."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210mik.txt
********************
I stepped out into the hallway and went to the room right next door.
#Satoshi
"Dr. Mikanagi, it's me."
The door opened, and Dr. Mikanagi stepped out into the hallway.
#Mikanagi
"What is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"Um, I'd like to prepare for an attack by the culprit here tonight..."
#Mikanagi
"An attack by the culprit...? Could such a thing happen?"
#Satoshi
"I don't know. But... I think the probability is high."
#Mikanagi
"Hmm... but in that case, wouldn't it be better to go to someone else's place instead of mine?"
#Satoshi
"There's a chance you'll be targeted too, Dr. Mikanagi."
#Mikanagi
"Even so... since we're in adjacent rooms, I'd notice if something happened, wouldn't I? I think it'd be fine if you just came over then."
#Satoshi
"...You have a point."
That's certainly true.
There's no need to intentionally be in the same room.
#Mikanagi
"Well, I'm going to bed soon, so see you tomorrow."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... good night."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210nar.txt
********************
I arrived at Narumi-san's room on the east side of the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Narumi-san emerged.
#Narumi
"What do you want at this hour...?"
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san, I want to protect you tonight."
#Narumi
"...Ah, right."
...She replied in an incredibly cold voice.
#Narumi
"Protect me from what?"
#Satoshi
"Well, from the culprit, of course."
#Narumi
"Why would I be targeted?"
#Satoshi
"Well... I just had a feeling."
#Narumi
"...Look, there are dozens of other people who are more likely to be targeted."
#Satoshi
"Th-That might be so, but..."
#Narumi
"Don't worry about me. You're a guest, so just get some rest in your room."
With just that, Narumi-san went back into her room.
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

********************
I arrived at Tsujimura-san's room on the north side of the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san stepped out into the hallway.
#Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"Um, I've decided to stay here tonight to protect you from the culprit, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Pardon...? But is there even any proof that someone like myself would be targeted by the culprit?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know for sure. But... given the current situation, it wouldn't be strange no matter who's being targeted."
#Tsujimura
"Haha... I'll be fine. Besides, patrolling the manor is my responsibility, after all."
#Satoshi
"But..."
#Tsujimura
"You're a guest, so please get some rest in your room. I'll let you know if anything happens."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
Having been told that, I had no words to offer in return.
#Satoshi
"...Well then, excuse me. Um, sorry for bringing up such a strange thing."
#Tsujimura
"No, no, please don't worry about it. Well then, good night."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210shi.txt
********************
I stepped out of the office.
Even at night, the snow continued to fall without cease.
I hurried toward the tower.
I entered the tower and went up the stairs to the second floor.
#Shion
"Who is it...?"
#Satoshi
"It's me, Shion-san."
When I called out, I heard the sound of the door being unlocked.
#Shion
"Is... something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san... I'm going to stay here tonight to protect you."
#Shion
"Eh..."
Shion-san gasped.
And for good reason.
Anyone would be surprised if they were suddenly told something like that.
#Satoshi
"Right now, the person most likely to be targeted by the culprit is you, Shion-san. So, I want to protect you no matter what."
#Shion
"B-But..."
#Satoshi
"Of course, I don't mean staying inside your room. Since there's only one entrance here, I'll stand guard on the first floor of the tower."
#Shion
"But... um, it'll get cold... you'll catch a cold."
#Satoshi
"I'm young, so I'll be fine."
#Shion
"Um... in that case, there are spare blankets in the storage room downstairs..."
Shion-san offered.
#Satoshi
"Ah, that's... thank you very much. That'll be a big help."
#Shion
"Um... please don't overexert yourself, okay?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
I parted with Shion-san and went down to the first floor.
Just as she’d said, I pulled a blanket out from the storage room, wrapped myself in it, and sat down on the very bottom step of the stairs.
This place is far from the manor.
It'd be hard for anyone to notice if something happened.
However, there's only one entrance.
If anyone tries to harm Shion-san, staying here means I'll definitely notice.
#Satoshi
"Phew..."
Now, I just have to endure until dawn.
I wonder if I'll be able to sleep even a little bit...
#Satoshi
"I'm young, so I'll be fine. Well then—"
Just as I said that and turned to leave.
#Shion
"A-Ah, um—"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
Someone grabbed the hem of my clothes from behind.
#Satoshi
"W... what is it...?"
#Shion
"Um..."
Shion-san kept her head down while still gripping the hem of my clothes.
#Shion
"Well... I-I trust you... so please... stay in my room and... protect me."
#Satoshi
"Eh... but..."
#Shion
"...To tell you the truth, I don't think I'll be able to sleep... could you please... tell me some fun stories or something...?"
Shion-san's hands were trembling slightly.
#Satoshi
"...I understand."
She really must be scared; Shion-san gently opened the door wide and invited me into the room.
I sat down on the chair Shion-san offered and began to talk.
#Satoshi
"Well then... I'll tell you about something that happened at university. Though I'm not sure if it'll be interesting."
#Shion
"No... would you let me hear it?"
#Satoshi
"...It's about Souko-san, who came here with me; she's just someone who has no luck whatsoever. Whenever she tries to buy something, it's guaranteed to sell out right in front of her."
#Shion
"Oh my..."
#Satoshi
"Besides that, she was the only one whose exam question sheet was blank, or her pepper lid broke and her ramen turned into a disaster..."
#Shion
"That... sounds tough..."
#Satoshi
"Anyway, she's unlucky in all sorts of minor ways. I get caught up in it too... like the books I need for research always being on loan no matter how long I wait..."
I continued talking for a while.
Shion-san was nodding with a soft expression on her face.
Thank goodness... it seems her anxiety has faded.
#Satoshi
"Ah... sorry, I've been doing all the talking."
#Shion
"No... it's alright. I don't have any fun stories to tell others, after all."
Shion-san said, sounding a little bit lonely.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Shion
"...University sounds like a fun place, doesn't it."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... well."
#Shion
"It felt very fresh. You can't understand it just from reading books... thank you."
Shion-san bowed while looking bashful.
#Satoshi
"No... I'm happy if you enjoyed it."
#Shion
"Hehe..."
#Satoshi
"...W-Well, shall we get some rest soon? It's getting late..."
#Shion
"You're right..."
#Satoshi
"Then, could you just lend me a blanket? I'll be by the door."
#Shion
"Y-Yes..."
Shion-san brought a blanket over from the bed.
#Shion
"Is this alright...?"
#Satoshi
"Thank you."
I took the blanket, draped it over myself, and sat down by the door.
#Satoshi
"It might be a bit unsettling, but... good night, Shion-san."
#Shion
"Yes... good night."
Shion-san turned off the light.
This place is far from the manor.
It'd be hard for anyone to notice if something happened.
However, there's only one entrance.
If anyone tries to harm Shion-san, staying here means I'll definitely notice.
Now, I just have to endure until dawn.
I wonder if I'll be able to sleep even a little bit...

--------------------
02a_2210sok.txt
********************
I arrived at Souko-san's room.
I knocked on the door and waited for a while.
The door opened, and Souko-san peeked her face out.
#Souko
"Oh, what brings you here at this hour?"
#Satoshi
"Um... Souko-san, is it alright if I stay in this room tonight?"
#Souko
"...Huh?"
Souko-san blinked in surprise.
#Satoshi
"Ah, no, I don't mean anything weird by it, it's just that things are dangerous, so I thought maybe I could protect you if we were together."
I offered a faltering excuse.
#Souko
"Hah... look, there's no point in protecting someone like me, is there?"
Souko-san murmured as if exasperated.
#Satoshi
"B-But... in this situation, we don't know who'll be targeted next, you know?"
#Souko
"At the very least, you and I aren't going to be targeted. We're outsiders, aren't we?"
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
I felt a trace of anxiety, but having been told that by Souko-san, I had no words to offer in return.
#Souko
"...It's frustrating, but right now, all we can do is wait. Let's pray that there aren't any more victims."
#Satoshi
"...I understand."
I guess all I can do is endure tonight...
#Satoshi
"Well then, Souko-san, good night. ...Excuse me."
#Souko
"Yeah, good night."

--------------------
02a_2210tak.txt
********************
I arrived at Takamine-san's room on the north side of the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Takamine-san, it's me."
I knocked on the door and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
Is he not there... or has he already gone to sleep...
Staying here like this isn't going to get me anywhere.
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.

--------------------
02a_2210ven.txt
********************
I arrived at Benio-san's room.
I knocked lightly on the door.
#Benio
"...Who is it?"
#Satoshi
"It's me."
The door opened.
#Benio
"What is it?"
#Satoshi
"...Benio-san, is it alright if I stay in this room tonight?"
#Benio
"...Begone, you fool."
#Satoshi
"W-Wait! I don't mean anything strange by it at all!"
I desperately tried to hold the door open as Benio-san tried to close it.
#Benio
"...Then why?"
#Satoshi
"I... I want to protect you, Benio-san."
#Benio
"Wha... d-don't say such ridiculous things."
Benio-san turned her face away.
#Benio
"W-Well... if you insist that much, I suppose I could consider it."
#Benio
"Why did you come to my place?"
#Satoshi
"I think you're the one most likely to be targeted next, Benio-san. So I thought maybe if I was by your side, I could protect you..."
#Benio
"Targeted... me? To eliminate a nuisance, you mean."
#Satoshi
"I don't know what the culprit's intentions are. But... I don't want any more sacrifices."
#Benio
"Hmm..."
#Satoshi
"I might not be reliable, but even so... I'll prove that I can be useful."
#Benio
"...Alright. Then I'll count on you."
#Satoshi
"Leave it to me."
I bowed to Benio-san and made a move to step out into the hallway.
#Benio
"Hmm...? Where do you think you're going?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... well, the hallway, of course. We can't exactly be in the same room, can we?"
#Benio
"Ah... no, that might be true, but... it'll be cold in the hallway, won't it?"
#Satoshi
"That's true too. Then I'll go and grab a blanket."
#Benio
"...There's no need for that, you can just stay in the room, can't you?"
#Satoshi
"But that's—"
#Benio
"It's fine. ...I couldn't bear it if you caught a cold."
Benio-san pulled on my arm and closed the door.
#Satoshi
"W-Well then... I'll stay here."
I leaned my back against the door and sat down on the floor.
#Benio
"You didn't have to go that far..."
Benio-san let out a breath, hands on her hips.
#Benio
"You're quite stubborn, aren't you."
Benio-san pulled a blanket off the bed and tossed it over to me.
#Benio
"Tell me if you're cold. I'll get another one."
#Satoshi
"No, I'm fine. Thank you."
#Benio
"Hmph..."
I wrapped myself in the blanket.
At least if I'm here, nobody will be coming in from the outside.
Besides, I'll also be able to tell what's going on in the hallway out front, if only a little.
If something happens to Maya-san, I'll be able to notice.
If something happens to Ai-san or Maya-san, I'll be able to notice.
#Benio
"...Hey."
#Satoshi
"Yes?"
#Benio
"Don't people often tell you that you're a fool?"
#Satoshi
"That's not true at all."
I retorted a bit heatedly.
#Satoshi
"Don't people often tell you that you're strange, Benio-san?"
#Benio
"I've never been told that."
She pufffed out her chest and lied straight to my face.
#Satoshi
"Jeez... but you have all sorts of strange things in this room, don't you."
#Benio
"What do you mean, 'strange'? How rude."
Benio-san pulled a book from the bookshelf.
#Benio
"This is a book recording the secret arts of the Kabbalah left behind by Agrippa. I studied German and Hebrew solely to read this, you know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
I don't really get it.
#Benio
"Thanks to that, my understanding of tarot has deepened considerably; shall I tell your fortune?"
#Satoshi
"Is it accurate?"
#Benio
"Of course it is. Who do you think I am?"
...I wonder where this confidence comes from.
I wanted her to guess who the culprit in this case was, but I felt hesitant to ask.
It'd be a disaster if she named the wrong person as the culprit.
Besides... it seemed as though Benio-san was deliberately trying to steer the conversation away from the case right now.
She must be anxious after all.
#Benio
"Well then, shall I tell your fortune in love? Mind you, don't complain even if it comes out as hopeless."
Benio-san began happily shuffling the cards.
Wait, I didn't ask for that...
#Satoshi
"...You're cute."
#Benio
"Pfft—!?"
Benio-san choked at my casual remark.
The cards scattered across the bed.
#Benio
"Wh-What are you saying, you bastard!?"
#Satoshi
"No, it just felt... heartwarming, somehow."
#Benio
"...Don't tease your elders, you fool."
#Satoshi
"Weren't we the same age?"
#Benio
"I am much more mature mentally."
The way she gets all heated like that is what's heartwarming... I thought, but I didn't say it out loud.
It wouldn't be strange if a fist came flying my way soon.
#Benio
"...You really are a fool."
Benio-san said that and showed me one of the scattered cards.
It had 'THE FOOL' written on it.
#Satoshi
"Haha... I guess so."
#Benio
"He's a fool, but on the other hand, it can also be read as an unconventional genius. I look forward to seeing which one you become."
Benio-san chuckled.
#Benio
"Well... shall we get some sleep soon?"
#Satoshi
"You're right."
I re-wrapped myself in the blanket she’d given me.
#Benio
"Well then, good night."
The light went out.
I heard the sound of Benio-san getting into bed.
#Benio
"Phew..."
After she let out a long breath, everything grew quiet.
Still, the blizzard outside occasionally shook the window.
I hope nothing happens tonight...
Not just in this room, but in this entire manor.
I bowed to Benio-san and stepped out into the hallway.
Now then.
I crouched down on the floor with my back against the door of Benio-san's room.
Staying here means if something happens to Maya-san, I'll be able to notice.
Staying here means if something happens to Ai-san or Maya-san, I'll be able to notice.
I closed my eyes.
I hope nothing happens tonight...

--------------------
02a_2210z.txt
********************
I stepped out into the hallway.
From now until morning—there are about nine hours left, but until then, I'll somehow keep patrolling the manor.
...I don't know if I can hold out until the end.
Still, it should be much better than doing nothing at all.
I began my patrol.

--------------------
02a_2230.txt
********************
I returned to my room.
I locked the door and flopped down onto the bed.
#Satoshi
"Haa..."
I'll just go to sleep.
My body is well and truly exhausted.
I made sure my shoes and clothes were ready so I could move immediately if something happened.
It would be best if nothing happened...
When I closed my eyes and let my body go limp, drowsiness washed over me.
Unable to resist it, my consciousness rapidly drifted away.

--------------------
02a_2600.txt
********************
#Satoshi
"Mnh..."
I woke up.
That sound just now...
I turned my head and looked at Shion-san's bed.
She wasn't there.
Had she just left?
Maybe she went to use the bathroom...
Even so, it bothers me that she didn't say a single word to me.
Did she take care not to wake me, or...
#Satoshi
"............"
I stood up.
If it's nothing, then fine.
If it is something... I have to make sure.
I went down the stairs and shivered at the cold.
...The door was open.
Did she go outside...?
#Satoshi
"Ngh..."
I woke up with the feeling that my body had been shaken.
I wonder what that was...
I looked around.
The door was open.
#Satoshi
"Eh..."
I looked up the stairs.
Nobody was there.
Did Shion-san go outside...?
I looked out from the doorway.
Through the blizzard, in front of the office door, Shion-san was standing still.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san!?"
Without even answering my call, she went into the manor.
#Satoshi
"Wait, Shion-san!"
I entered the office and called out to her again.
Shion-san turned around in silence.
A hollow gaze that I couldn't tell where she was looking.
#Satoshi
"What's the matter... Shion-san?"
#Shion
"...Eh?"
Even though I’d been right there, she looked at me with an expression as if she’d been caught off guard.
#Shion
"Ah..."
#Satoshi
"Shion-san!?"
I hurried to catch Shion-san as she collapsed from her knees.
She seemed to have lost consciousness.
No... it felt more like she was simply asleep rather than having lost consciousness.
I hesitated over whether to go call Dr. Mikanagi, but I picked Shion-san up.
She was startlingly light.
I'll take her back to her room.
She's probably fine.
She was surely just sleepwalking.
I easily carried her to the second floor of the tower and laid her on the bed.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Shion
"............"
...Is she alright?
I adjusted the covers for her, wrapped myself in a blanket in the corner of the room, and crouched down.
I'll try to stay awake as much as possible.
So I can respond immediately if anything happens to Shion-san.

--------------------
02b1_1244.txt
********************
#Akane
"This way!"
Akane-san ran along the passage surrounding the atrium.
Beyond that, there was an inconspicuous door.
#Akane
"There's a ladder inside that leads to a room above."
#Satoshi
"Understood. I'll go first."
No telling what might be there.
I swapped places with Akane-san, who had opened the door, and went inside.
I climbed the ladder, the sound of my footsteps echoing.
It was pitch black and I couldn't see a thing.
When I reached the top, I could tell there was a door nearby.
A tiny bit of light was filtering in through a small window in the door, perhaps from outside.
I peeked inside.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san!?"
Ai-san was in there.
...Ai-san's toes were hovering just slightly above the ground.
Something like a rope was wound around her neck, and she was being suspended by it.
...The rope was pulled taut.
I wonder how much time has passed.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san! Are you alright!?"
I reached for the doorknob, but pulled my hand away in surprise at a stinging pain.
The doorknob and a iron pipe running along the wall had been tied together with wire.
#Satoshi
"You've... got to be kidding... right...?"
I tried to turn the knob, but of course the door wouldn't open.
However, it didn't seem to be locked.
But—
#Akane
"No... young lady..."
Akane-san covered her face.
#Satoshi
"We don't... know yet. I have to open it somehow..."
Saying so.
I was remembering that if suffocation continues for more than a minute, there's almost no chance of survival.

--------------------
02b1_1245.txt
********************
Akane-san went to call people, and Souko-san, Dr. Mikanagi, and Tsujimura-san arrived and lowered Ai-san to the floor.
#Mikanagi
"I'm sorry, but..."
Dr. Mikanagi, who had checked Ai-san's pulse, shook his head.
#Souko
"...What happened?"
Souko-san asked.
#Satoshi
"............"
Unable to answer, I looked down.
#Souko
"...Akane-san, could you tell me what happened?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes..."
Akane-san was talking to Souko-san.
Even though Akane-san must be hurting too, she was answering bravely.
#Souko
"I see... it must have been tough."
Souko-san was comforting Akane-san.
#Souko
"...We're going to investigate."
Souko-san spoke to me.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Souko
"Don't 'Eh' me. We have to find the culprit somehow... otherwise the number of victims will only increase."
#Satoshi
"How could this..."
#Souko
"Don't just daze off, pull yourself together."
#Satoshi
"...Yes."
Rallied by Souko-san, I stood up.
Right beside me was Ai-san's body.
I offered a silent prayer for a moment, then turned back to Souko-san.
#Satoshi
"...Let's investigate."
#Souko
"Yes."

--------------------
02b1_1245s.txt
********************
There's a small window for letting in light.
It doesn't seem to be locked, but it's so small that it'd be impossible for a person to pass through.
There's no chance the culprit came in or out through here.
#Satoshi
"This is the rope that was around Ai-san's neck..."
#Souko
"Wire is woven into it... it doesn't look like it'd be easy to cut."
#Satoshi
"One end is firmly fixed to the wall... the other end was caught in the gears of the clock."
...This rope is likely what took Ai-san's life.
#Satoshi
"What is this stick...?"
I picked up a piece of wood that had fallen to the floor.
#Souko
"It doesn't look like something that has any particular meaning, but..."
A wooden stick is lying there.
The gears that move the clock.
Their movement has been stopped now.
The gears aren't moving.
A small piece of trash, like a scrap of paper, is lying on the floor.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but...
No matter how many times I look at it, it just looks like trash.
Dr. Mikanagi placed his hands together in prayer before Ai-san's body and began the autopsy.
#Mikanagi
"...There's a contusion on the head, but this isn't the direct cause of death. It seems death was indeed caused by suffocation due to neck compression."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...It seems Ai-san's cause of death was suffocation.

--------------------
02b1_1245z.txt
********************
That's probably enough.
#Satoshi
"Is this about right?"
I asked Souko-san.
#Souko
"If you say so, then I think it's fine."
#Satoshi
"Being told that makes me feel anxious, though..."
Keep investigating.
That's probably enough.
Let's try investigating a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I've investigated everything I can.
#Satoshi
"That should be enough."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, let's carry Ai-san's body. It'd be pitiable to leave her in a place like this forever."
#Satoshi
"...You're right."
We wrapped Ai-san's body in a brand-new sheet.
#Souko
"Are we carrying her to her room?"
#Mikanagi
"...Yeah."

--------------------
02b1_1325.txt
********************
Cooperating with Dr. Mikanagi, we carried Ai-san's body down to the second floor.
#Satoshi
"...We should probably block this place off too, right?"
#Souko
"Let's ask Tsujimura-san to do that later."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, I'll take Ai-san to her room."
Dr. Mikanagi picked up Ai-san's body.
#Satoshi
"Please."
#Souko
"Let's head to the hall. Everyone should be gathered there."

--------------------
02b1_1330L04.txt
********************
We returned to the Great Hall.
#Souko
"...There aren't many people here."
It didn't seem like everyone in the manor had gathered.
#Akane
"The Madam and Dr. Mikanagi are in the infirmary."
#Satoshi
"What about Shion-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama is in her own room."
#Souko
"...I see."
Souko-san looked somewhat dissatisfied.
#Takamine
"It shouldn't matter. Just get started already."
Takamine-san said, making no effort to hide his displeasure.
#Souko
"...It can't be helped. Well then, I'm going to start asking about things that are bothering me."

--------------------
02b2_1245.txt
********************
Shion-san was in the hall.
#Shion
"Ah..."
She stood up from the sofa upon seeing me.
#Shion
"Um... has Ai-oneesama been found?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
Ai-san is missing...?
#Shion
"...It seemed as though Akane-san was looking for her earlier... and I grew quite frightened..."
Shion-san trembled.
#Satoshi
"She... hasn't been found yet."
#Shion
"Is that so... I'm feeling quite scared..."
Shion-san trembled.
#Satoshi
"It'll be alright, so please don't worry."
I offered words that could easily be taken as empty consolation.
Even if she thought so, I wanted to ease her anxiety even just a little bit.
#Shion
"I... I'm going back to my room."
Shion-san murmured with her head down.
#Satoshi
"I'll walk you there."
Without thinking, those words slipped out.
#Shion
"Eh...?"
#Satoshi
"I think it's better if you don't move around alone. ...I don't have any proof, but."
#Shion
"But..."
#Satoshi
"It'd be better if Tsujimura-san were here... at least as far as the office. It's right nearby, though."
#Shion
"Then... please do."
Shion-san gave a small nod.
Tsujimura-san was not in the office.
#Shion
"Um... this far is enough. It's cold outside, so..."
#Satoshi
"Is that so...?"
#Shion
"Um... thank you very much."
Shion-san bowed.
#Satoshi
"We don't know what might happen, so please make sure to lock your door firmly."
#Shion
"...Yes. Well then."
Shion-san opened the back door.
It seemed as though the snow was still falling.
I...
Follow her.
Return to the hall.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san!"
I called out to Shion-san as she turned her back.
#Shion
"Yes...?"
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll walk you to the tower after all."
#Shion
"B-But..."
Shion-san looked outside.
#Shion
"...Well then, please do."
#Satoshi
"Yeah."
I stepped outside first so Shion-san wouldn't be hit by the wind.
#Satoshi
"Are you alright?"
I called out to Shion-san behind me.
#Shion
"Yes, I'm used to it."
For all she said that, she was huddling up against the cold.
When we arrived at the entrance to the tower, Shion-san opened the door just as it was.
#Satoshi
"Don't you keep it locked?"
#Shion
"...No, not particularly."
#Satoshi
"...I think it'd be better if you kept it locked from now on."
#Shion
"I wonder... if so."
Shion-san tilted her head.
#Satoshi
"Because we don't know what might happen yet."
The culprit who killed Rokuyou-san is still in the manor, after all.
Although I avoided such direct words, Shion-san shrank back anxiously.
#Shion
"...Please, come in."
Shion-san closed the door.
The heating must be working; it was faintly warm inside.
#Satoshi
"By the way, is your headache alright now?"
#Shion
"...It's a regular thing, so there's no need for worry."
#Satoshi
"I see... take care."
#Shion
"Yes, thank you very much."
Shion-san headed toward the stairs.
I felt hesitant to accompany her any further.
#Shion
"Shion-san"
#Shion
"Yes...?"
She turned back as she set foot on the stairs.
#Satoshi
"I'll be going now. ...See you later."
#Shion
"...Yes."
I stepped outside.
Two sets of footprints remained on the narrow path.
My footprints from my return journey were being left behind me.
The snow is still falling.
These footprints will surely disappear eventually.
Snow is piled up on both sides of the path, making it look as though it'd be impossible to go anywhere else.
I decided to hurry back to the Great Hall.
#Shion
"...Thank you very much. But... I think I'll stay here after all..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"Well then... see you later."
Shion-san left.
It can't be helped; I'll return to the hall.
#Satoshi
"Well then... see you."
#Shion
"...Yes."
Shion-san left.
I'll return to the hall too.

********************
After confirming that no one was around, I returned to the attic.
She, suspended in mid-air, didn't move an inch.
The gears of the clock had also ceased their movement.
As I untangled the wire caught in the gears, the corpse crumbled to the floor.
There was still work to be done.
I had also brought the hand axe I’d taken from the storage room.
$ I swung the axe down toward the neck of the corpse lying on the floor.
A dull thud echoed, and the head went rolling away amidst a spray of blood.
Taking meticulous care not to be splattered by the blood, I moved to the wall and opened the window.
The snow came billowing in.
I wrapped the head in a scrap of cloth and threw it toward a spot where the snow looked deep.
This will do.
With this—it will be perceived as a serial murder case.

--------------------
02b2_1255.txt
********************
As I stepped out into the hallway, I happened to run into Benio-san.
#Benio
"Hello there."
#Satoshi
"Hello."
#Benio
"You're quite the lady-killer, aren't you."
#Satoshi
"Eh?"
#Benio
"You were walking Shion back, weren't you?"
#Satoshi
"Were you watching...?"
I let out a sigh.
#Satoshi
"It's not anything like that."
#Benio
"And what exactly is 'that'?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san just lost her husband—well, Rokuyou-san—didn't she?"
#Benio
"The ceremony wasn't completed, so they never actually became husband and wife, did they?"
#Benio
"...It's not as if they were in love, either."
#Satoshi
"But still..."
#Benio
"—I suppose anyone would have sufficed, so long as they were the one to liberate her from that tower."
Benio-san murmured to herself.
#Satoshi
"Benio-san—?"
#Benio
"Setting that aside, has my sister been found yet?"
#Satoshi
"Eh, no... not yet..."
#Benio
"I see..."
#Souko
"Oh, what are you two doing in a place like this?"
Souko-san came walking over from the direction of the hall.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san... Ai-san hasn't been found yet."
#Souko
"I see..."
#Benio
"There's no point in just talking here. Let's head to the hall for now and figure out our next move."
#Satoshi
"...You're right."
In the Great Hall were Maya-san and Dr. Mikanagi.
Maya-san looked terribly haggard.
#Maya
"Um... has Ai... been found...?"
I silently shook my head.
#Maya
"Is... that so..."
#Mikanagi
"Let's go to the infirmary."
At Dr. Mikanagi's urging, Maya-san stood up.
#Maya
"Please... find Ai..."
After bowing to us, Maya-san left.
Tsujimura-san entered as she was leaving.
#Tsujimura
"Where is the Madam...?"
#Souko
"She doesn't seem to be feeling well."
#Tsujimura
"I see..."
Tsujimura-san was also lacking energy.
#Tsujimura
"I've looked around the basement and other areas... but Miss Ai was nowhere to be found..."
#Satoshi
"Is there anywhere we haven't looked yet?"
#Tsujimura
"Even if you say that... I cannot enter the guests' rooms..."
#Souko
"Is there a possibility she went outside?"
Tsujimura-san shook his head at Souko-san's question.
#Tsujimura
"There were no footprints at the front entrance or the back door. Though, since it's still snowing, any footprints might have been erased as time passed."
#Satoshi
"The last time I saw Ai-san was just before eleven. That would be two hours ago now..."
#Benio
"In two hours, unless it was a fierce blizzard like last night, footprints wouldn't completely disappear."
#Souko
"If that's the case, then she's almost certainly still inside the building..."
#Satoshi
"But—"
And with that, I swallowed my words.
But—if she still hasn't turned up after all this searching.
#Benio
"—Tsujimura."
Benio-san spoke up.
#Tsujimura
"Yes, what is it?"
#Benio
"Did you check the attic?"
#Tsujimura
"—!"
Tsujimura-san gasped.
#Souko
"The attic?"
#Benio
"Yes. Didn't the bell ring at midnight last night? There's a room where that machinery is kept."
#Souko
"You said it usually only rings at noon. ...I wonder if it rang earlier?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
Come to think of it... did I hear the sound of the bell?
#Benio
"...I didn't really pay much attention to it."
#Tsujimura
"Yes... I'm ashamed to admit that I wasn't paying attention either."
#Satoshi
"...Let's go. Maybe—"
Ai-san might be there.
#Souko
"...You're right. Tsujimura-san, please lead the way."
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... this way."
Souko-san and I followed behind Tsujimura-san as we left the hall.

--------------------
02b2_1300.txt
********************
#Tsujimura
"This way."
We went up the stairs and proceeded along the passage surrounding the atrium.
Beyond that, there was an inconspicuous door.
#Tsujimura
"There's a ladder inside that leads to the attic room above."
#Satoshi
"...Let's go."
I took the lead and stepped inside.
I climbed the ladder, the sound of my footsteps echoing.
It was pitch black and I couldn't see a thing.
When I reached the top, I could tell there was a door nearby.
A tiny bit of light was filtering in through a small window in the door, perhaps from outside.
I peeked inside.
#Satoshi
"Eh..."
I had opened the door before my mind could even process what I was looking at.
A sharp smell of blood hung in the air.
A human body, lying sprawled on the floor.
Blood, soaking the floor.
A hand axe, discarded.
#Satoshi
"A... Ai-san...?"
#Tsujimura
"A... aahh, Miss Ai..."
Tsujimura-san fell to his knees.
#Souko
"This is... horrible."
Frowning, Souko-san entered the attic room.
#Souko
"...The clothes she's wearing are the same. But without a head... I can't be sure if it's really her."
#Satoshi
"What do you mean... who else could it possibly be!?"
It's undoubtedly Ai-san.
#Souko
"Calm down. ...Tsujimura-san, could you go call Dr. Mikanagi?"
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... right away."
Tsujimura-san stood up and left the room.
#Souko
"...I think it's Ai-san too. But..."
And then, Souko-san looked around.
#Souko
"...Where's the head?"
#Satoshi
"Eh..."
I also looked around the room.
A small attic room that was by no means spacious.
Within my field of vision, Ai-san's head was nowhere to be found.
#Satoshi
"...Is it the same... as with Rokuyou-san...?"
#Souko
"Likely..."
Souko-san bit her lower lip.
I heard the sound of someone climbing the ladder from outside the room.
#Mikanagi
"............"
Dr. Mikanagi, who had hurried into the room, let out a breath.
#Mikanagi
"So... it's come to this..."
After we offered a silent prayer, Souko-san spoke up.
#Souko
"...Let's investigate. We can't just leave her lying here forever."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."

--------------------
02b2_1300s.txt
********************
There's a small window for letting in light.
It doesn't seem to be locked, but it's so small that it'd be impossible for a person to pass through.
There's no chance the culprit came in or out through here.
#Satoshi
"...The blood must have sprayed when the neck was cut."
#Souko
"But... the head is missing again."
#Satoshi
"Did they take it with them...?"
#Souko
"I don't understand the reason. Unless this body belongs to someone other than Ai-san."
#Mikanagi
"...I'm certain it's Ai-san. I've examined her before, so I wouldn't mistake her."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...They likely decapitated her here.
Dr. Mikanagi placed his hands together in prayer before Ai-san's body and began the autopsy.
#Mikanagi
"...It hasn't been very long since the neck was severed. However... I can see some slight livor mortis. Did someone move the body?"
#Satoshi
"No... it's just as we found it."
#Mikanagi
"The livor mortis is appearing toward the legs. Normally, it occurs as congestion in the parts of the body that are underneath, but it's not appearing on the arms... which are currently the lower part."
#Souko
"The culprit moved the body...?"
#Mikanagi
"...They likely killed her using some other method first, then moved the body and severed the neck."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...The beheaded body of Ai-san lies there.
The gears that move the clock.
Their movement has been stopped now.
The gears aren't moving.
#Satoshi
"...A snowdrop."
A single white flower had fallen to the floor.
#Satoshi
"Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san...?"
#Souko
"Likely so..."
#Satoshi
"This flower is...?"
A single white flower had fallen to the floor.
Why would it be in a place like this...
#Souko
"It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall... I wonder if the fact that only the flower head has fallen is a metaphor for the headless body..."
#Satoshi
"...That's a gruesome thought."
The snowdrop flower has fallen.
A small piece of trash, like a scrap of paper, is lying on the floor.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but...
No matter how many times I look at it, it just looks like trash.
#Satoshi
"An axe again...?"
#Mikanagi
"...They likely used that to sever the neck. The cut surface is just like the one on Isamu."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...It seems the same thing that happened to Rokuyou-san has occurred.

--------------------
02b2_1300z.txt
********************
That's probably enough.
#Satoshi
"Is this about right?"
I asked Souko-san.
#Souko
"If you say so, then I think it's fine."
#Satoshi
"Being told that makes me feel anxious, though..."
Keep investigating.
That's probably enough.
Let's try investigating a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I've investigated everything I can.
#Satoshi
"That should be enough."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, let's carry Ai-san's body. It'd be pitiable to leave her in a place like this forever."
#Satoshi
"...You're right."
We wrapped Ai-san's body in a brand-new sheet.
Part of the sheet was stained red.
#Souko
"Are we carrying her to her room?"
#Mikanagi
"...Yeah."

--------------------
02b2_1325.txt
********************
Cooperating with Dr. Mikanagi, we carried Ai-san's body down to the second floor.
#Satoshi
"...We should probably block this place off too, right?"
#Souko
"Let's ask Tsujimura-san to do that later."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, I'll take Ai-san to her room."
Dr. Mikanagi picked up Ai-san's body.
#Satoshi
"Please."
#Souko
"Let's head to the hall. Everyone should be gathered there."

--------------------
02b2_1330L05.txt
********************
We returned to the Great Hall.
#Souko
"...There aren't many people here."
It didn't seem like everyone in the manor had gathered.
#Akane
"The Madam and Dr. Mikanagi are in the infirmary."
#Satoshi
"Is Shion-san in her room?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, she is."
#Souko
"...I see."
Souko-san looked somewhat dissatisfied.
#Takamine
"It shouldn't matter. Just get started already."
Takamine-san said, making no effort to hide his displeasure.
#Souko
"...It can't be helped. Well then, I'm going to start asking about things that are bothering me."

--------------------
02b_1210.txt
********************
Akane-san went to call people, and Souko-san, Dr. Mikanagi, and Tsujimura-san arrived.
#Mikanagi
"I'm sorry, but..."
Dr. Mikanagi, who had checked Ai-san's pulse, shook his head.
#Souko
"...What happened?"
Souko-san asked.
#Satoshi
"............"
Unable to answer, I looked down.
I couldn't save her.
She was right in front of me, but I couldn't save her.
I'm filled with a regret I can't express.
If only I had made a more sound judgment.
If I had, Ai-san would still be alive.
#Souko
"...Akane-san, could you tell me what happened?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes..."
Akane-san was talking to Souko-san.
Even though Akane-san must be hurting too, she was answering bravely.
#Souko
"I see... it must have been tough."
Souko-san was comforting Akane-san.
#Souko
"...We're going to investigate."
Souko-san spoke to me.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Souko
"Don't 'Eh' me. We have to find the culprit somehow... otherwise the number of victims will only increase."
#Satoshi
"How could this..."
#Souko
"Don't just daze off, pull yourself together."
#Satoshi
"...Yes."
Rallied by Souko-san, I stood up.
Right beside me was Ai-san's body.
I offered a silent prayer for a moment, then turned back to Souko-san.
#Satoshi
"...Let's investigate."
#Souko
"Yes."

It doesn't seem to be locked, but it's so small that it'd be impossible for a person to pass through.
There's no chance the culprit came in or out through here.
#Satoshi
"This is the rope that was around Ai-san's neck..."
#Souko
"Wire is woven into it... it doesn't look like it'd be easy to cut."
#Satoshi
"One end is firmly fixed to the wall... the other end was caught in the gears of the clock."
...This is the rope that strangled Ai-san right before my eyes.
#Satoshi
"What is this stick...?"
I picked up a piece of wood that had fallen to the floor.
#Souko
"It doesn't look like something that has any particular meaning, but..."
A wooden stick is lying there.
The gears that move the clock.
Their movement has been stopped now.
The gears aren't moving.
A small piece of trash, like a scrap of paper, is lying on the floor.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but...
No matter how many times I look at it, it just looks like trash.
Dr. Mikanagi placed his hands together in prayer before Ai-san's body and began the autopsy.
#Mikanagi
"...There's a contusion on the head, but this isn't the direct cause of death. It seems death was indeed caused by suffocation due to neck compression."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...It seems Ai-san's cause of death was suffocation.

"The Madam and Dr. Mikanagi are in the infirmary."
#Satoshi
"What about Shion-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama is in her own room."
#Souko
"...I see."
Souko-san looked somewhat dissatisfied.
#Takamine
"It shouldn't matter. Just get started already."
Takamine-san said, making no effort to hide his displeasure.

--------------------
02b_1400i.txt
********************
#Souko
"Let's leave it at that for now."
It turned two o'clock, and Souko-san wrapped things up.
#Satoshi
"...Did you find anything out?"
#Souko
"Asking that is my job, you know."
Souko-san said with a wry smile.
#Souko
"But well... if I were to give my own impression, there wasn't anything that would serve as decisive evidence."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Souko
"A time-delayed murder using the gears of the clock—nobody turned up who had an alibi for the time the mechanism was likely set. Including you and me."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"As a summary for this stage, it'll be difficult to find the culprit. So, let's start thinking about the motive."
#Satoshi
"The motive... huh. The reason for killing Rokuyou-san and Ai-san..."
#Benio
"—It's about the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"Whoa!?"
Benio-san suddenly cut in from behind me.
#Benio
"Well, that would make me the most suspicious person, though."
Benio-san chuckled.
#Souko
"...Do you want the inheritance?"
#Benio
"Didn't I say this morning that I wasn't interested?"
Benio-san continued.
#Benio
"Well, even if I'm not interested, if I'm eligible, the inheritance will come to me."
#Souko
"...It seems best to keep in mind that this might be an incident related to the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"But if that's the case—"
I looked at Benio-san.
#Benio
"What is it?"
#Satoshi
"...I think the probability of you being the next victim increases, Benio-san."
#Souko
"You're right... or perhaps Shion-san."
#Benio
"Hmm... that's not a very pleasant thought."
Benio-san crossed her arms.
#Satoshi
"Please be extremely careful, Benio-san."
#Benio
"I know."
#Souko
"By the way, who do you think is the culprit so far?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... me...?"
#Souko
"Of course, you can't tell anyone else right now. I don't want to breed unnecessary suspicion. But... I want to confirm it."
#Benio
"Hmm... true enough. Let's hear your brilliant reasoning. I don't mind if you point to me as the culprit."
#Satoshi
"Umm... well..."
#Souko
"Me? Why?"
#Satoshi
"Please don't get angry, okay?"
#Souko
"It's your opinion, so I won't get mad, but..."
#Satoshi
"It's simply because you don't have an alibi..."
#Souko
"Maya-san, huh... I wonder."
#Benio
"...If it's about the inheritance, it's not unthinkable. If the number of heirs decreases, the share coming to oneself increases."
#Satoshi
"...Though it doesn't feel very realistic."
#Souko
"...Ai-san is dead, isn't she?"
#Satoshi
"...I'm just saying that suicide is a possibility. If you catch the rope in the gears and put your neck through while it's loose..."
#Benio
"...I see. It's not an impossible scenario... but what would be the cause of the suicide?"
#Satoshi
"Perhaps... it's because Rokuyou-san died?"
#Souko
"That would be convincing, but it's too hasty to jump to that conclusion."
#Benio
"...Agreed."
#Satoshi
"You're right... it would be dangerous to discard the possibility of homicide."
#Benio
"No fool would call that situation a suicide."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Benio
"...Hmm, you're certainly right. If we consider the inheritance, the motive isn't entirely absent."
#Satoshi
"I'm just stating possibilities, so please don't be angry."
#Benio
"I'm not angry."
#Satoshi
"You clearly are..."
#Souko
"Shion-san, huh... they seemed to be on good terms, but I wonder..."
#Benio
"There's no evidence... but there might be a motive, just as there is for me."
#Satoshi
"That's true..."
#Benio
"Tsujimura, huh... it wouldn't be impossible, but..."
#Souko
"Since he's Mr. Kousei's brother, there's a possibility he could inherit, but... I doubt that man would think of something like this."
#Benio
"I agree with that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Souko
"...Look, Rokuyou-san is already dead."
#Benio
"Are you trying to say he's come back from the grave?"
#Satoshi
"No, I'm just saying it's a possibility."
#Souko
"If that body isn't Rokuyou-san, then who on earth is it?"
#Satoshi
"Well... sorry, I was wrong."
#Benio
"Pull yourself together..."
#Benio
"Takamine is the culprit... he did say he was confined to his room the whole time, but..."
#Souko
"But there's no evidence. ...Seriously, I'm glad he isn't here right now."
#Benio
"Truly. He'd have punched you if he'd heard that."
#Satoshi
"You're probably right..."
#Benio
"...If the Doctor were the culprit, it'd be tough. I wouldn't be able to believe in anything."
#Souko
"...You're right. Forget about the autopsy, we wouldn't even be able to take medicine if we felt unwell."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Wasn't Akane-san with you?"
#Satoshi
"...Can't we consider that that might have been the excuse for creating an alibi?"
#Souko
"You're free to think that, but... if that were the case, I don't think she would have guided you to where Ai-san was."
#Benio
"Perhaps she was trying to incite a sense of urgency at the very last second... but it's difficult."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Akane-san, huh... based on her usual behavior, it's hard to think so..."
#Satoshi
"...But I think it's dangerous to easily remove her from the suspects."
#Benio
"...Perhaps. Though, I think it's also a problem to suspect someone without any confirmation."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Benio
"If Narumi were the culprit, it'd be terrifying. We'd hardly be able to eat."
#Souko
"That's true... so you won't be eating the food Narumi-san made?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... why does it come to that?"
#Benio
"There's a possibility it's been poisoned, isn't there? If you really hate it, you'll just have to cook for yourself."
#Satoshi
"That'd be tough..."
#Souko
"As long as the culprit isn't identified, the only measure we have is to defend ourselves."
#Satoshi
"...You're right."

--------------------
02b_1500.txt
********************
Narumi-san stopped in front of the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Everyone else, to the dining hall. I'll bring lunch over."
#Akane
"Understood."
#Satoshi
"Ah, I'll help too."
I stepped forward a few paces and stood beside Narumi-san.
#Narumi
"Hmm...? Fine, help me then."
#Satoshi
"Yeah."
Narumi-san opened the door to the kitchen.
#Narumi
"—Are you planning to keep an eye on me?"
As soon as we were alone, Narumi-san brought it up.
#Satoshi
"That's not it."
#Narumi
"I wonder. You don't think I'm going to poison the food, do you?"
#Satoshi
"I don't think that. After all, if the food was poisoned, the first person to be suspected would be you, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"So you're saying I wouldn't do something so stupid?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Narumi
"...You seem to think more rationally than that lawyer."
Narumi-san let out a breath.
#Satoshi
"You mean Takamine-san? ...Things certainly seemed tense earlier..."
#Narumi
"He has a big frame but a small heart, that man."
Narumi-san spat out.
#Satoshi
"A-Anyway, let's take the food over."
#Narumi
"Ah, right. Just wait a second."
Saying so, Narumi-san headed toward the stove.
It seemed she was reheating the rice in a pot.
#Narumi
"Well then, could you start taking the plates I've served to the dining hall?"
#Satoshi
"Understood."
I took several plates of fried rice and headed to the dining hall.

--------------------
02b_1510.txt
********************
#Satoshi
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
I set the plates of fried rice down in front of the four people in the dining room—Souko-san, Benio-san, Akane-san, and Tsujimura-san.
#Benio
"Did you perform a poison test?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Benio
"It's immediately after such an incident. Lawyer Takamine's argument is understandable."
Benio-san stared intently at the plate of fried rice.
#Benio
"Of course, I don't intend to suspect Narumi in the slightest, but wouldn't it be possible to slip in poison while she's away from the kitchen?"
#Satoshi
"If you start saying things like that... you won't be able to eat anything."
#Benio
"...I know."
#Souko
"I think the probability of poison being mixed in is low."
Souko-san spoke up.
#Satoshi
"Why is that?"
#Souko
"If you look at the victims—the way Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were killed—they were killed when they were alone. I don't feel like the culprit would use a method that targets an unspecified large number of people."
#Benio
"Hmm—so if they're going to kill, they'll do it for certain. True, if this food were poisoned and we all gathered and ate at once, the culprit would be in trouble."
#Souko
"In that case, they'd either find some reason not to eat, or use some other method of evasion."
#Benio
"...Besides, poisoning is too different an image from the murders so far."
Even though her sister, Ai-san, has been killed, Benio-san is grasping things calmly and objectively.
#Benio
"—That being said, I cannot definitively state that there is no poison in this."
#Souko
"...You're right."
#Satoshi
"...That's just up to the culprit's mood, after all."
#Tsujimura
"I... I shall perform the poison test."
Tsujimura-san suddenly said.
#Benio
"Tsujimura...?"
#Tsujimura
"I cannot allow Miss Benio or the guests to be placed in danger. I shall be the one—"
Tsujimura-san scooped up some fried rice with a soup spoon.
His hand was trembling slightly.
#Tsujimura
"E-Excuse me... mnh."
Tsujimura-san chewed the fried rice.
#Akane
"Ts-Tsujimura-san...?"
Akane-san timidly offered a glass filled with water.
#Tsujimura
"Mnh... mnh... haah..."
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
Sweat was appearing on Tsujimura-san's forehead.
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes..."
He answered in a trembling voice after drinking the water from the glass.
#Benio
"—He seems to be alright."
Benio-san, who had been watching Tsujimura-san for a while, made the decision.
#Benio
"Sorry about that, Tsujimura."
#Tsujimura
"No... this is about the only thing I can do..."
#Souko
"...Let's eat too."
We also began our meal.
#Souko
"...Mm, it's delicious."
Souko-san savored the food.
#Benio
"Well, her skills are certainly genuine."
#Akane
"Though, watching her while she was making it, you'd never imagine it would turn out like this."
#Narumi
"...I can hear you, you know."
Narumi-san emerged from the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Could you take some food to Madam and Shion-ojousama as well?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, understood."
I was handed three plates piled with fried rice.
For Maya-san, Shion-san, and Dr. Mikanagi, I assume.
#Satoshi
"What about Takamine-san's portion...?"
#Narumi
"There's no need to feed him."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
It seems she's still holding a grudge about what happened earlier.
Well... first I'll head to where Maya-san likely is, in the infirmary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
02b_1515.txt
********************
I arrive in front of the infirmary, knock lightly on the door, and open it.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me. I've brought lunch."
Dr. Mikanagi and Maya-san are in the infirmary.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, thank you."
#Maya
"……Thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"I'll leave it right here."
I place the plate on Dr. Mikanagi's desk.
#Satoshi
"……Well then, I'll be going."
Unable to bear the somber atmosphere any longer, I leave the infirmary.

--------------------
02b_1520.txt
********************
Now I have to deliver food to Shion-san as well.
I pass through the office and head outside.
The snow is still falling as steadily as ever.
The door was unlocked.
Hoping to get the fried rice to her before it gets cold, I hurry up the stairs.
In front of the door to Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me. I've brought lunch."
Shion-san peeks her face out.
#Shion
"Ah…… thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going."
#Shion
"A-Ah, um……!"
#Satoshi
"Yes?"
#Shion
"Well…… p-please be careful……"
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
After answering Shion-san, I decide to head back to the dining room.

--------------------
02b_1530.txt
********************
I've returned to the dining room.
#Satoshi
"Oh, where's Souko-san?"
Souko-san is nowhere to be seen.
#Benio
"It seems she went back to her room."
Benio-san is relaxing while drinking cocoa.
Tsujimura-san and Narumi-san aren't here either.
#Benio
"I suppose she can't settle down in a place where a murderer might be lurking nearby."
#Satoshi
"How about you, Benio-san?"
#Benio
"Me? ……Well, I suppose it's the same for me."
#Satoshi
"……Are you actually feeling anxious?"
#Benio
"I am a delicate maiden, after all."
Benio-san blurts out something unexpected.
No, she's right, but she has an air about her that makes it seem like she's almost enjoying this situation.
#Satoshi
"……I see."
Of course, I can't say that to her face, so I stay quiet.
With Rokuyou-san and Ai-san both murdered, there's no telling when Benio-san might be targeted.
#Satoshi
"……Please be careful too, Benio-san."
#Benio
"What's this? Are you that worried about me?"
Benio-san's lips curl into a smirk.
#Satoshi
"Of course I am."
#Benio
"……I see."
Benio-san suddenly crosses her arms as if lost in thought.
#Benio
"……Hey, are you——"
Benio-san's words are cut short by the sudden meow of a cat.
#Benio
"……Are you worried too, Love?"
#Benio
"Hehe…… I see."
Benio-san picks up the cat.
#Benio
"——I think I'll head back to my room as well."
#Satoshi
"Is that so…… Um, about what you were going to say just now——"
#Benio
"……It's nothing. Forget it."
Benio-san turns her face away.
#Satoshi
"I see……"
#Benio
"Well then, see you later."
Benio-san leaves the dining room.
I wonder what she wanted to say……
#???
"……Um, are you finished?"
#Satoshi
"Whoa!?"
Startled by the sudden voice, I turn around to find Akane-san standing there looking apologetic.
#Satoshi
"A-Akane-san……"
#Akane
"……I thought it would be rude to interrupt since you two seemed to be in your own little world……"
#Satoshi
"……No, it wasn't anything like that……"
#Akane
"I-Is that so……?"
How do I put it…… this person is pretty unusual too……
#Akane
"Oh, that's right."
Akane-san brings over a plate of fried rice.
#Akane
"Um, I'd like you to take this to Takamine-sama's room, if you would……"
#Satoshi
"Eh? But Takamine-san said he didn't want any……"
#Akane
"Even so, he needs to eat. Please tell him that I've performed a poison test myself, so he can rest easy."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
Well, it might be better for me to take it rather than Akane-san or someone else from this house.

--------------------
02b_1545.txt
********************
I leave the dining room and head to the north hallway on the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Takamine-san, it's me."
The door opens.
#Takamine
"Do you need something?"
A blunt Takamine-san appears, though he doesn't seem particularly grumpy.
#Satoshi
"I brought food. And…… can we talk for a bit?"
There's something I want to confirm.
#Takamine
"……I don't mind."
Takamine-san opens the door wide.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
Takamine-san's room is neatly organized.
A photo frame is placed on the shelf.
#Takamine
"Well, have a seat."
Takamine-san offers me a chair, so I sit down quietly.
#Takamine
"I believe I told you I didn't need any food."
#Satoshi
"But you won't last long if you don't eat, you know? I've performed a poison test, so it's fine."
#Takamine
"……Hmph."
Takamine-san reluctantly accepts the plate of fried rice.
He places the plate on the shelf and knocks over the photo frame.
#Takamine
"——So, what did you want to talk about?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, um…… I wanted to ask about Mr. Kousei's will……"
Takamine-san's gaze sharpens.
#Takamine
"……Do you think I can tell that to an outsider?"
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right, of course……"
I guess it's impossible after all……
#Takamine
"……However, given the situation."
#Satoshi
"Eh……?"
#Takamine
"You're looking for the culprit, aren't you? It might provide some sort of clue."
It seems Takamine-san is willing to cooperate.
#Satoshi
"Th-Thank you very much."
#Takamine
"Keep in mind, it's only what I can remember. Mainly the method of distributing the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"That's more than enough. ……I heard that even if Rokuyou-san married Shion-san, there would be no benefit."
#Takamine
"Ah…… that matter."
#Satoshi
"Is that because Shion-san is adopted?"
#Takamine
"I don't know what his personal motives were. However, the will stated that the inheritance was to be divided equally among Nanatsuki Maya, Nanatsuki Ai, and Nanatsuki Benio, one-third each."
#Satoshi
"If that's the case…… then Shion-san really wouldn't receive a single cent."
#Takamine
"If she had married Rokuyou-kun, she would have gained access to the Rokuyou family's assets. But even that is no longer possible."
#Satoshi
"Was this marriage proposed by Rokuyou-san?"
#Takamine
"That's what I heard. I don't know what his intentions were, but Maya-san was said to be delighted."
#Satoshi
"Was it just getting rid of a nuisance after all……?"
#Takamine
"……Perhaps."
Takamine-san lets out a long breath.
#Takamine
"That's about all I can tell you."
#Satoshi
"Thank you very much."
I wanted to ask more, but this seems like the right time to leave.
#Satoshi
"Well then, excuse me."

--------------------
02b_1600.txt
********************
I've returned to my room.
#Satoshi
"Phew……"
I flop down onto the bed.
I feel strangely exhausted.
I suppose it's only natural…… Rokuyou-san was killed this morning, and Ai-san was killed at midday……
The culprit must still be lurking somewhere.
The culprit…… who could it be?
I don't want to doubt anyone, but the culprit must undoubtedly be among the people I've met here.
If this series of crimes is related to the inheritance, it doesn't explain why Rokuyou-san was killed first.
He had no right to the inheritance to begin with.
That being said, I haven't found any other clues that link the two incidents.
Except for the fact that Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were on good terms.
Even if I wanted to ask for more details, Ai-san is already——
I close my eyes.
I'll sleep…… just for a bit.
I've locked the door, so it should be fine.
Besides…… I'm an outsider, so there's no reason for me to be targeted.
……Though that doesn't mean I can afford to be careless.

--------------------
02b_1610h.txt
********************
After finishing her meal, Shion washed the dishes on the first floor of the tower.
The water this time of year was freezing, and the skin on Shion's hands was cracked in several places.
If she took the dishes to the kitchen, I'm sure someone else would wash them.
But Shion couldn't bring herself to leave it to others.
Because she was nothing more than a dependent.
She was only allowed to live here out of pity.
She climbed the stairs and went back to her room.
She applied cream to her hands and sat down on the bed.
"Haa……"
The atmosphere in the manor was stifling.
She knew the reason why.
The fact that her sister, Ai, had been murdered.
Shion had no idea what was actually happening.
$ Ai had always been very kind to Shion.
She had loved Shion.
She had wrapped Shion, who was forced to live alone in the tower, in her kind, warm hands.
"Ai-oneesama……"
Unknowingly, Shion's hand reached down toward her crotch.
"Nnh……"
Touching her private parts over her underwear, she let out a small voice.
"Mmm…… ha…… ah……"
She moved her fingertips slowly, as if kneading.
"Mnn…… nnh, ha…… ah……"
She was remembering the times Ai had played with her.
"Haa…… ah, Oneesama……"
Ai had loved Shion so much.
"Nnh…… Ai-oneesama……"
Why did she have to die?
"Haa…… ah, nnh……"
She rubbed the area around her clitoris with the pad of her finger.
"Nnh…… ngh, haa……"
A bit of love juice had begun to seep out from her vaginal opening.
"Mmm…… nnh, ha…… ah……"
When was it that she first learned of masturbation?
Imprisoned in this black tower since she was a child, Shion had eventually learned this solitary game.
In a room where no visitors ever came, she simply toyed with her own genitals.
She had learned from books that it was a shameful thing. That's why she could never tell anyone.
Even so, she couldn't give up the pleasure once she had learned it.
"Ha, ah…… nnh, mmm……"
Even though no one would hear her if she let her voice out, Shion kept her mouth shut to suppress the sound.
"Mnn…… ah, ha…… kuh…… mnh……"
Just toying with herself over her underwear wasn't enough anymore.
"Mnn…… ahh……"
She slipped her fingers inside her underwear.
Her fingers were easily swallowed into the moisture-filled honey pot.
"Nnh…… ah, ha, haah……"
She let out a long breath.
Every time she moved her fingers, a squelching, lewd sound echoed.
"Mnh…… ah, ha…… haa, anh……"
While tracing the folds of her vaginal opening with her fingers, she teased her clitoris with her thumb.
"Haa…… ah, mnn…… ha, ah……"
She brought her free hand to her own breast.
"Nnh…… ha, kuh…… mnh……"
She slowly kneaded and squeezed it over her clothes.
"Ha, ah…… mnn…… ngh, kuh…… mnh……"
It became too much of a bother to even keep her body upright, and Shion collapsed onto the futon.
"Ha, ah, haah…… nnh, ngh……"
When she pulled down her underwear, her juices were forming long threads.
"Haah, ah, ngh…… ngh, hyan……"
Exposing her crotch to the air, she continued her self-pleasuring.
"Ngh…… ha, ah…… haa…… anh……"
She traced the inside of her labia with her fingers.
"Haa…… ah, aahh…… Oneesama……"
That was the place Ai used to lick so often.
"Nnh…… haa, ah, aahh……!"
She moved her fingers while remembering the things Ai had done to her.
"Ah, ha, nnh, Oneesama……"
Her hips began to bounce and twitch.
"Haa, ah, aahh……!"
She squeezed her thighs tightly.
"Ah, haa, ah…… ngh……"
While her hips continued to writhe and squirm, Shion basked in the afterglow of a light climax.
"Ha, ah…… nnh……"
Even so, Shion continued to toy with her wet, secret lips.
She couldn't get the fever in her body to subside.
"Nnh…… ha, ngh…… nnh……"
She shouldn't be such a lewd woman.
"Haa…… ah, ahh, ngh……"
She couldn't stop her fingers.
"Ah, ha, nnh, ngh…… mnn, kuh…… mnh……"
She stirred up the inside of her honey-filled vagina.
"Haa, ah, aahh…… nnh, ngh, kuh…… mnh!"
It was as if her vaginal opening had become a separate living creature, tightening around Shion's fingers.
"Ha, ah, nnh, ngh…… mnh……"
Her love juices foamed white, making a bubbling sound.
"Ah, nnh, ha, kuh…… mnn!"
She scratched her clitoris with the tip of her fingernail.
"Haa…… aahh! Ha, nnh, ngh……!"
The sensation below her waist began to vanish as if it were going numb.
"Mnh, ngh…… m-more, ah, aahh……!"
Even though her heart wanted to stop, her body craved the pleasure.
"Mnh, ngh, ha, ah! Nnh! Kuh…… haa, ah!"
A massive wave was crashing over her.
"Haa, ah! Nnh! Hiee…… I-I'm going…… mnh, ah, aaaahhh!"
"Aaaahhh! Ha…… ah, nnaahhh…… kuuh, ngh……"
Her entire body trembled more violently than ever before.
"Haa, ah…… aahh……"
An intense feeling of lethargy washed over her.
"Haa…… ah, aahh……"
Coming back to her senses, she was struck by a wave of intense regret.
"Aahh…… I-I am…… such a……"
I'm not such a lewd woman.
I'm not some slut who drowns in pleasure.
"U…… uugh…… sob……"
Shion covered her face with both hands and sobbed for a long while.

********************
……I've woken up.
It's already pitch black inside the room.
Checking the clock, it's almost five-thirty.
The light reflected off the snow is filtering in through the window.
Thanks to that, it isn't complete darkness.
I get up from the bed and head to the light switch by the door.
I squint at the glare.
Now then…… my body is rested, so what should I do now——
Suddenly, the lights cut out.
#Satoshi
"Eh——?"
With a start, I flick the wall switch again.
……Nothing changes.
#Satoshi
"A blackout……?"
My eyes are adjusting.
I wonder what happened……?
I step out into the hallway.
The lights are out here as well.
Dr. Mikanagi isn't around; there's no sign of him coming out of the infirmary or his own room.
I'll head toward the atrium……

--------------------
02b_1830.txt
********************
By the time I return to the hall, people are starting to gather.
#Takamine
"What happened?"
Takamine-san asks.
#Souko
"Yes…… it seems the generator was tampered with."
#Mikanagi
"Whatever for……?"
#Benio
"Doctor, first we're going to confirm everyone's safety."
Benio-san cuts Dr. Mikanagi off and speaks up.
#Benio
"Lawyer Takamine and the Doctor are here. Where are Mother and the others?"
#Mikanagi
"Maya-san is in the drawing room. Narumi-san and Akane-san are there as well."
#Benio
"……What happened to Shion?"
#Mikanagi
"She's likely in her room, isn't she?"
#Satoshi
"I'll go check on her."
I say that before I even think.
#Benio
"Hmm…… alright. Then I'll leave it to you."
Seeing Benio-san nod, I hurry toward Shion's tower outside the manor.

--------------------
02b_1840.txt
********************
I head outside through the back door of the office.
The snow is still falling as steadily as ever.
I hurry toward the tower, leaving fresh footprints on the narrow path.
I step inside and brush off the snow.
First, I have to confirm Shion-san's safety.
I head up the stairs.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me. Please open up."
I call out and wait for a moment.
The door opens, and Shion-san timidly peeks her face out.
#Shion
"Ah……"
#Satoshi
"Thank goodness…… Shion-san, it must have been dark, right?"
#Shion
"No…… it's always dim here anyway……"
#Satoshi
"Is that so…… at any rate, I'm glad you're safe."
#Shion
"……I see."
For some reason, Shion-san looks down as if dejected.
#Satoshi
"Is something the matter……?"
#Shion
"……No, it's nothing. Well then——"
Shion-san bows and closes the door.
I wanted to talk a little more, but…… it can't be helped, I'll head back to the manor.

--------------------
02b_1850.txt
********************
I've returned to the hall.
I turn my head at the sound of a bell.
A black cat is looking down at me from halfway up the stairs.
#Satoshi
"Love……?"
It's not as if it responded to my call.
The black cat is looking up toward the second floor.
Benio-san is standing at the top of the stairs.
#Benio
"So this is where you were."
I wonder which of us those words were addressed to, me or the cat.
#Benio
"Was Shion safe?"
She speaks to me as she picks up the black cat and walks down the stairs.
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
#Benio
"I see."
#Satoshi
"It's dangerous for you too, Benio-san, so please stay quiet in your room."
#Benio
"I know. But wouldn't it be safer if I were with you?"
#Satoshi
"……Is that because you think I'm not the culprit?"
#Benio
"There's no evidence that you aren't the culprit. But that's not it, I just feel at ease when you're nearby."
#Satoshi
"……Are you serious?"
#Benio
"Of course I am, don't you think?"
Benio-san smiles.
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and Tsujimura-san appears.
#Tsujimura
"Oh, Miss Benio."
#Benio
"……Tsujimura, were you listening?"
#Tsujimura
"Whatever do you mean?"
He doesn't look like he's feigning ignorance.
He was likely tinkering with the generator in the basement.
#Benio
"……Never mind, don't worry about it."
#Tsujimura
"As you wish."
Tsujimura-san bows.
#Benio
"I'm going back to my room."
Leaving only those words, Benio-san heads back up the stairs holding the black cat.
#Tsujimura
"……Do you have a moment?"
#Satoshi
"Eh, me?"
Called out to suddenly, I turn to face Tsujimura-san.
#Tsujimura
"It wouldn't do to talk here, so shall we head to the office?"
#Satoshi
"Eh, yeah. I don't mind."
#Tsujimura
"Then, this way."
I follow Tsujimura-san to the office.

--------------------
02b_1900.txt
********************
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
I follow Tsujimura-san into the office.
#Tsujimura
"Please, have a seat over there."
I sit down on the chair as suggested.
#Satoshi
"Um…… Tsujimura-san?"
I ask Tsujimura-san what he wants to talk about.
#Tsujimura
"……My apologies. For things to turn out like this……"
#Satoshi
"No…… it's not your fault, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"However…… with Mr. Rokuyou murdered and Miss Ai dead…… as the one responsible for managing this manor, I feel terribly sorry……"
Tsujimura-san looks down.
He looks so small.
#Tsujimura
"……In the past, something similar happened."
#Satoshi
"Something similar……!?"
#Tsujimura
"No, naturally nobody died. However…… because of my own incompetence, I once caused a great deal of trouble for the Madam and the others……"
At Tsujimura-san's confession, I feel a slight sense of relief.
I couldn't bear it if things like this happened all the time.
#Tsujimura
"Even now, I find myself thinking about it. I wonder if there was something more I could have done back then. It might be far too late for regrets now, though."
#Satoshi
"Tsujimura-san……"
#Tsujimura
"I'm begging you. Even if it's only while you're here…… could you please protect the young lady, Shion-ojousama……?"
#Satoshi
"Well…… of course. I want to protect everyone."
#Tsujimura
"Ah…… thank you very much."
Tsujimura-san bows deeply.
#Satoshi
"That reminds me, when I went to check on Shion-san earlier, she seemed a bit dejected……"
#Tsujimura
"……If she seems to be troubled by something, please, by all means, offer her your advice."
#Satoshi
"Yeah, understood. But…… I don't know how much help I can be, having only just met her……"
#Tsujimura
"Her way of thinking will be completely different from an old man like myself. Someone closer to her age should be the one to listen to her."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
It's true, I wanted to talk to Shion-san a little more.
She must be feeling anxious too.
That's why I wanted to take away that anxiety, even if only a little.
#Satoshi
"……I'll go check on her for a bit."
#Tsujimura
"Understood. I'm counting on you."

--------------------
02b_1930.txt
********************
When I step out of the office, the fierce blizzard is as intense as ever.
A faint trail of small footprints continues toward the tower.
Those are likely Shion-san's footprints.
I step into the tower.
Shion-san is on the second floor.
I go up the stairs and knock on the door.
#Shion
"Yes……?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
After I call out, the door opens from the inside a moment later.
#Shion
"Um…… is something the matter……?"
Shion-san's eyes are moist.
I wonder if she’s been crying……
#Satoshi
"I came to make sure that everyone is alright."
#Shion
"……I see."
Shion-san looks down.
#Satoshi
"Umm…… so——"
#Shion
"Please, come in……"
Shion-san opens the door and invites me inside.
#Satoshi
"Ah…… excuse me."
#Shion
"……Did you come here to watch me?"
#Satoshi
"Eh…… no, that's not it at all?"
#Shion
"Then…… why……?"
#Satoshi
"……Because I'm worried about you, Shion-san."
I voice my honest feelings.
#Satoshi
"It's partly because Tsujimura-san asked me to…… but I can't just leave you be. Not someone living all alone in a place this far removed."
#Satoshi
"Besides…… Ai-san has been murdered as well. You might be a target for the culprit too, Shion-san."
#Shion
"But, I……"
#Satoshi
"I'll definitely find the culprit. So…… until then, I'll make sure to protect you, Shion-san."
Shion-san stays silent and looks down.
#Satoshi
"Um…… was I being a nuisance, perhaps……?"
#Shion
"……No, that's…… not the case."
Shion-san shakes her head.
#Satoshi
"Umm…… sorry, I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself……"
#Shion
"No…… th-thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"W-Well then, I'll be going……"
In that awkward atmosphere, I bow and leave Shion-san's room.

--------------------
02b_2005.txt
********************
When I reached the top of the stairs, I heard the sound of a guitar from somewhere.
#Satoshi
"Hmm……?"
I turn my head and look in the direction of the sound.
It's coming from toward Souko-san's room.
Ah…… there was a music room over there as well.
I'll take a quick peek.
The hallway on the east side of the second floor.
The room at the very end is the music room.
The door is slightly open.
As I thought, the sound of the guitar is coming from there.
I wonder who it is……
I quietly peek inside through the gap in the door.
……Souko-san is sitting by the window with a guitar.
#Souko
"……Oh, it's just you."
Souko-san turns her gaze toward me and lets out a sigh of relief.
#Satoshi
"……It's dangerous to be in a place like this all by yourself."
#Souko
"I know. That's why I kept the lights dim, but……"
#Satoshi
"Light was leaking into the hallway. And if the sound is leaking out too, there's no point."
#Souko
"……Maybe so."
Souko-san lets out a wry smile.
#Satoshi
"……Souko-san, aren't you exhausted?"
#Souko
"……I might be. With everything that's happened, it's only natural……"
She lightly strums the guitar.
My eyes are drawn to the knot of the bandage wrapped around her finger.
#Souko
"That's why I was playing a little to clear my head."
#Satoshi
"It's a nice song."
#Souko
"Thanks."
#Satoshi
"Could you let me hear a bit more?"
#Souko
"……Then I'll play a different one."
Saying so, Souko-san adjusts her guitar.
She begins to play.
It's a very beautiful melody.
#Satoshi
"Eh……?"
The sound of a bell mingles in.
I see the black cat has entered the music room.
#Satoshi
"Love……?"
Letting out a soft meow, the black cat heads back toward the door.
#Benio
"So this is where you were."
Benio-san enters.
#Satoshi
"Benio-san…… were you looking for Love?"
#Benio
"Yeah."
The black cat gives one meow and runs toward the piano at the back of the room.
#Souko
"Oh……?"
Souko-san stops playing the guitar.
#Benio
"What is it, do you want me to play?"
#Benio
"Alright, alright."
Benio-san heads to the piano.
#Souko
"Well then, shall we play together?"
At Souko-san's signal, they begin to play in unison.
The sounds of the piano and guitar blend together.
Even though this must be their first time playing together, it's so magnificent that it doesn't feel like it at all.
The black cat, lying near the piano, is also listening contentedly.
It's a sound that feels more like kindness than loneliness.
#Benio
"——Not bad."
#Souko
"You too."
The two of them look at each other.
At times like this, I wish I could play an instrument too.
Though I suppose not getting in the way is for the best.
If only Shion-san's singing voice were added to this——
It would surely be a truly wonderful session.
The sound of applause echoes from the door.
#Narumi
"Incredible, incredible, you two are perfectly in sync."
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san……?"
#Narumi
"I brought dinner, but the young lady wasn't in her room, so I was looking for her."
#Benio
"Ah, sorry. I was looking for Love."
#Narumi
"Haa…… well then, are you going to eat?"
#Benio
"Of course. What about you two?"
Benio-san looks at us.
#Satoshi
"Well, I mean…… I am hungry."
#Souko
"I didn't even think about food."
#Narumi
"Yes, yes, I've got enough for everyone, so don't worry."
Narumi-san brings a cart in from the hallway.
#Narumi
"It's just rice balls and tea, but better than nothing, right?"
#Souko
"Yes, of course."
We spread a mat on the floor and sit in a circle.
#Narumi
"Don't worry, there's no poison in them."
#Satoshi
"I'd never even think you'd put any in."
I stuff my mouth with a salty rice ball.
#Benio
"Is it good?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah, of course."
#Benio
"……Hmm, it seems to be fine then."
#Satoshi
"……Did you just use me as a poison tester?"
#Narumi
"I told you not to worry, didn't I?"
Narumi-san pouts.
#Souko
"I don't think we have to worry much about poison."
Souko-san says as she drinks her tea.
#Satoshi
"Why's that?"
#Souko
"The culprit is human too. They wouldn't put poison in something they might eat themselves."
#Benio
"Besides, avoiding the non-poisoned ones would only strengthen everyone's suspicions."
#Narumi
"Please don't talk about things that make the food taste bad."
#Benio
"I suppose you're right."
#Souko
"Benio-san, did you learn piano from Mr. Kousei?"
Souko-san changes the subject.
#Benio
"No, from Tsujimura."
#Satoshi
"Eh, is that so?"
I thought Tsujimura-san was a painter……
#Benio
"Including my father, the Tsujimura family was a family of musicians, after all. My father's music was difficult, so it was easier to have Tsujimura teach me."
#Narumi
"The sheet music the master wrote still trades for high prices even today, after all."
#Benio
"I can't even play them properly just by looking at them."
#Souko
"It'd be impossible unless you're a professional."
The conversation continues with topics I can't follow at all.
#Satoshi
"But…… is Mr. Kousei's inheritance really that substantial?"
I ask Benio-san what’s been on my mind.
#Benio
"I suppose it is? I don't know the exact amount, though."
#Souko
"Is it because the Nanatsuki family has been prosperous for a long time?"
#Benio
"Ah—— no, the Nanatsuki assets are negligible. At most, the mountain and this manor. My father's inheritance is what he earned from composing."
#Satoshi
"I see……"
#Benio
"Well, there's nothing good to be inherited from the Nanatsuki family anyway."
#Souko
"……Are you talking about the curse?"
Benio-san nods at Souko-san's question.
#Benio
"Indeed. No one would ever want the 'Curse of Seven Possessions' if they could help it, would they?"
#Satoshi
"I would have thought you'd be delighted by it, Benio-san."
#Benio
"……A 'curse' is something created by humans. It's nothing mysterious."
#Satoshi
"……You're surprisingly realistic, aren't you."
#Benio
"Is that a problem?"
#Souko
"It's not a problem. If what is called the 'Curse of Seven Possessions' is actually happening, then there must be human intent behind it."
#Benio
"Precisely. There's a high probability that it's involved in this incident as well."
#Narumi
"Haa…… I wish you'd just give it a rest."
Narumi-san lets out a sigh.
#Narumi
"I'm only working here because the money is good, but if things like this happen, it's just not worth it."
#Benio
"……I suppose so. No matter how much money you make, it doesn't matter if you're dead."
#Souko
"……Let's leave the gloomy talk at that."
Souko-san stands up.
#Satoshi
"……You're right."
I really wanted to talk a little more, but I follow Souko-san and stand up.
#Souko
"It's likely best to stay in our rooms tonight as much as possible."
#Benio
"I suppose so. Though we can't force anyone. There are bound to be those who wander about no matter what."
Saying so, Benio-san stares intently at me.
#Satoshi
"Is that…… directed at me?"
#Benio
"You were moving around quite a lot today, weren't you? I just had a feeling you'd do the same tonight."
#Satoshi
"……I just feel like staying still won't solve anything."
#Benio
"……Perhaps."

********************
Even after the lights in the room went out, I continued to wait perfectly still.
Eventually, she returned to the room, accompanied by him.
That was fine.
He was acting exactly as I had anticipated.
She locked the door to the room.
Now then——
I didn't care if I was seen.
Since I’d already failed once, I had to ensure I finished the job this time.
I dragged her unconscious body away.
I placed her body in the bathtub and wound a cord around her neck, tightening it.
She showed a brief reaction as if waking for a split second, but soon ceased moving altogether.
Just to be safe, I gagged her and began filling the tub with water.
I took out the saw and placed it against her neck, just below the ligature mark.
Fresh blood sprayed out.
The pooling water was instantly stained red.
I had stripped naked to ensure not a single drop of back-spray would get on my clothes.
Even if blood got on my body, I could wash it off immediately.
She seemed to have died from suffocation after all.
Even as the cervical vertebrae were sawn through, she showed no further reaction.
I wrapped the severed head in a cloth, opened the window, and hurled it far away.
I couldn't see well because of the blizzard, but it didn't look like any blood had dripped.
After that, I switched on the lamp by the bed to confirm the power hadn't returned, then tore the cord off and dropped the end into the water-filled tub.
I couldn't say it was a particularly meaningful act, but I was sure they would find some sort of meaning in it.
I could trigger another blackout if needed.
That way——I could establish an alibi in a natural fashion.
$ Now then——time to return to my room.

--------------------
02c_1830.txt
********************
By the time I returned to the hall, a crowd had gathered.
#Takamine
"What happened?"
Takamine-san asked.
#Souko
"Yes…… it seems the generator was tampered with."
#Mikanagi
"Whatever for……?"
#Benio
"Doctor, first we're going to confirm everyone's safety."
Benio-san cut Dr. Mikanagi off and spoke up.
#Benio
"Lawyer Takamine and the Doctor are here. Where are Mother and the others?"
#Mikanagi
"Maya-san is in the drawing room. Narumi-san and Akane-san are there as well."
#Benio
"……Where are my sister and Shion?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, Ai-san should be in her room."
#Benio
"Hmm…… I see. Then let's go check."
#Satoshi
"Yes, understood."
I nodded and headed up the stairs with Benio-san.

--------------------
02c_1840.txt
********************
We went up to the second floor and stood before Ai-san's room.
#Benio
"Sister, it's me. Could you open up?"
Benio-san called out, but there was no response from inside.
#Benio
"……That's strange."
Benio-san reached for the doorknob.
#Benio
"It's open……?"
We stepped into Ai-san's room.
#Benio
"Sister……?"
#Satoshi
"Ai-san——"
She wasn't there.
I’d confirmed that she’d locked the door firmly earlier.
Did she leave, or——
#Satoshi
"……Let's look for her."
#Benio
"Of course."
Benio-san turned on her heel to leave the room, then stopped.
#Benio
"Love……?"
The black cat slipped between Benio-san's legs and ran into the room.
#Benio
"Where are you going? That's the bathroom——!?"
Benio-san froze.
Her gaze was fixed on the wall.
An electric cord extending from an outlet on the wall led toward the bathroom.
#Satoshi
"No way……!?"
We rushed to the bathroom, almost competing to get there first.
The sound of the bell on the black cat's collar echoed in the bathroom.
And then——
——Ai-san was there.
……Presumably, it was Ai-san.
A headless corpse was floating in the blood-red water of the bathtub.
The electric cord stretching from the room was submerged in the tub.
#Benio
"……Ridiculous."
Benio-san let out a breath.
#Satoshi
"How can this be……"
I reached my hand out toward Ai-san's body.
Benio-san grabbed my arm.
#Satoshi
"Benio-san……?"
#Benio
"……It's better not to move her."
She murmured with a stiff expression.
#Satoshi
"B-But…… like this……"
#Benio
"……We have to report this first. Moving my sister's body comes after the Doctor has examined her."
#Satoshi
"……Understood. But at least this……"
With trembling hands, I pulled the submerged electric cord out of the water.
Maybe this will——
#Benio
"……Let's go."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
We offered a silent prayer for Ai-san's body and left the room behind.

--------------------
02c_1850.txt
********************
With somber expressions, we returned to the hall.
Souko-san and Dr. Mikanagi were still there.
#Souko
"Where's Ai-san……?"
Souko-san rushed over.
But she stopped when she saw my face.
#Benio
"……Doctor, please examine my sister."
#Mikanagi
"Yes…… however……"
Dr. Mikanagi seemed to have sensed the strange atmosphere as well.
#Benio
"……I'm going to tell Mother and the others."
Without looking back, Benio-san left the hall.
#Souko
"……Let's go too. It's Ai-san's room, right?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes……"
……Unable to explain the state Ai-san was in, I simply followed behind Souko-san and the others as they headed up the stairs.

--------------------
02c_1900.txt
********************
Just as we reached the front of Ai-san's room, the hallway lights flickered on.
#Mikanagi
"It seems Tsujimura-san has repaired the generator."
#Souko
"……I wonder if it's because everyone besides Ai-san has been confirmed safe……"
#Satoshi
"……This way. She was found dead in the bathroom."
I said this as if to cut off Souko-san and the Doctor's conversation, then stepped into Ai-san's room.
#Souko
"……An electric cord has been pulled into the bathroom."
Souko-san found the cord stretching from the wall outlet.
#Satoshi
"……It was submerged in the tub when I found it."
#Souko
"I see……"
Souko-san tapped my shoulder lightly and entered the bathroom.
Dr. Mikanagi offered a silent prayer to Ai-san with a somber face.
#Souko
"This is horrible……"
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
#Mikanagi
"I want to pull her out immediately, but…… investigating here should come first."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
I gave a vague nod.
#Souko
"Pull yourself together, we're going to investigate here."
Souko-san slapped my back, and I began to move sluggishly.

--------------------
02c_1900s.txt
********************
It's the door leading back into the room.
An electric cord is coming in through the slight gap between the door and the floor.
I don't think there's any particular problem with the door itself.
On a towel hanging on the wall, a small piece of trash like a scrap of paper was stuck.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but……
There doesn't seem to be any back-spray from the blood on the towel.
#Satoshi
"Was this the cause of the short circuit……?"
#Souko
"Presumably so."
It seems the power cord submerged in the tub was the cause of the short circuit.
#Satoshi
"……A snowdrop."
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
#Satoshi
"Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san……?"
#Souko
"Likely so."
#Satoshi
"This flower is……?"
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
Why would it be in a place like this……
#Souko
"It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall…… I wonder if the fact that only the flower head has fallen is a metaphor for the headless body……"
#Satoshi
"……That's a gruesome thought."
A snowdrop flower is floating in the tub.
#Mikanagi
"……Let's wait until after we've pulled her out to perform the autopsy."
#Satoshi
"……You're right."
……I'll leave the examination of the body for later.
#Satoshi
"……The blood must have sprayed when the neck was cut."
#Souko
"But…… the head is missing again."
#Satoshi
"Did they take it with them……?"
#Souko
"I don't understand the reason. Unless this body belongs to someone other than Ai-san."
#Mikanagi
"……I'm certain it's Ai-san. I've examined her before, so I wouldn't mistake her."
#Satoshi
"I see……"
……They likely decapitated her here.

--------------------
02c_1900z.txt
********************
#Satoshi
"Is this about right?"
I asked Souko-san.
#Souko
"If you say so, then I think it's fine."
#Satoshi
"Being told that makes me feel anxious, though……"
Keep investigating.
That's probably enough.
Let's try investigating a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I've investigated everything I can.
#Satoshi
"That should be enough."
#Mikanagi
"Well then…… let's pull her out."
We drained the water from the tub, and Dr. Mikanagi and I lifted Ai-san's body out together.
We laid Ai-san's body down.
#Souko
"……Could you investigate the cause of death and such?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes…… however, I might not be able to determine anything very clearly."
Dr. Mikanagi began his examination of the body.
#Mikanagi
"If the head were still here, it would be clearer, but……"
#Souko
"Can you at least determine the cause of death and the time of death?"
#Mikanagi
"……Since she was in the water, I can't give an exact figure, but I don't think it's been even an hour since she died. As for the cause of death…… I wonder which it was……"
#Satoshi
"Which…… do you mean?"
#Mikanagi
"I can't tell which came first: the electrocution or the decapitation."
Dr. Mikanagi shook his head.
#Mikanagi
"It's thought that both occurred at almost the same time. However, if the decapitation came first, I can't find any meaning in what was done afterward."
#Souko
"……True, there would be no point in electrocuting a corpse."
#Satoshi
"Then…… as I thought……"
#Mikanagi
"It's safer to assume she was decapitated after being killed by electrocution, or at least after falling unconscious from it."
#Souko
"But if that's the case, doesn't that raise a question about the timing? The second blackout was just after six, and when you found Ai-san it was——"
#Satoshi
"……Only a little over ten minutes had passed since then."
#Mikanagi
"That would be enough time to sever a neck, but…… the number of people capable of doing it would be limited."
#Souko
"Let's try questioning everyone about that later."
#Satoshi
"Um…… Souko-san."
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Satoshi
"Could it be…… that I was the one who killed Ai-san……"
I was the one who fixed the generator.
If Ai-san died because the power was turned on——
#Souko
"……That's not true."
Souko-san placed her hand on my head.
#Satoshi
"But…… if I hadn't turned the generator back on——"
#Souko
"No. It was the culprit who set things up to turn out that way."
Souko-san said this while looking me straight in the eyes.
#Mikanagi
"……That's right. Someone had to fix the generator regardless. Besides…… Ai-san would likely have been killed even if the blackout had continued."
#Souko
"……I suppose so. I don't know why they would use such a roundabout method, though……"
Souko-san pulled on my hand.
#Souko
"Let's head back. You can ask the culprit about their intentions after we catch them."
#Satoshi
"……Yes."
Filled with an indescribable sense of gloom, I let Souko-san lead me by the hand as we left Ai-san's room.

--------------------
02c_1930L06.txt
********************
I headed to the Great Hall with Souko-san.
#Maya
"Dr. Mikanagi……"
Maya-san, appearing utterly exhausted, called Dr. Mikanagi over.
#Mikanagi
"……You don't seem to be feeling well."
Dr. Mikanagi went to Maya-san's side and checked her pulse.
#Souko
"——Everyone is here."
Scanning the room, Souko-san straightened her posture.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san……?"
#Souko
"Pull yourself together. You're going to be the one questioning everyone about this case from here on."
#Satoshi
"Me……?"
#Souko
"Just like this morning. Let's start by asking about anything that seems bothering."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
I didn't really feel up to it, but I suppose I'm the only one who can do it……

--------------------
02c_2000.txt
********************
#Souko
"I suppose that's about it."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
In the end, I felt like I hadn't been able to ask anything that really got to the heart of the matter.
#Benio
"Well then, shall we disperse? It's probably best not to leave our rooms too much tonight."
#Souko
"You're right…… what should we do about dinner?"
#Akane
"In that case, Narumi-san and I will bring it to everyone's rooms later."
#Narumi
"There shouldn't be a problem if the two of us carry it, right?"
Saying so, Narumi-san glanced over at Lawyer Takamine.
#Takamine
"Hmph……"
#Akane
"Then it's settled. Narumi-san, let's go."
#Narumi
"Right, right."
The two of them left the Great Hall.
Following their lead, one by one, everyone else left the room.
……I should head back to my room as well.

--------------------
02z_1200.txt
********************
I've returned to my room.
#Souko
"Things turned out quite horribly, didn't they……"
Souko-san, who returned with me, murmured.
#Satoshi
"They really did…… what should we do now?"
#Souko
"Assuming help arrives in two days…… the police will come, and Shion-san will be arrested, I suppose. That'll make it difficult to research the local legends around here."
#Satoshi
"Are we going home?"
#Souko
"……Yeah. It seems best to just stay quiet."
Saying so, Souko-san took out a bottle of Coke.
#Souko
"I wonder if this will last another two days…… I'll have to drink it sparingly."
#Satoshi
"But…… there are still things that aren't clear. The motive, for one, and the whereabouts of Rokuyou-san's head, the phone line, even the suspension bridge——"
#Souko
"Let's leave all that to the police when they arrive. Since she confessed, they'll find a way to tie it all together, even if they have to force it."
#Satoshi
"But——"
Somehow, it didn't sit right with me.
I should have solved the case——so what was this nagging feeling?
The culprit had been found.
But…… I felt as though everything else had been buried away in the darkness.
