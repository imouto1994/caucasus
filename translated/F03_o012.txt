「...At the very least, the culprit has no intention of letting anyone escape from here.」
＃Protagonist
「...It seems that way.」
＃Maya
「Even the suspension bridge... Now we can't even call for help...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Benio
「...Unintentionally, it turned out exactly as I told you all yesterday. We're isolated and without aid, but we have supplies for a few days, so it shouldn't be a problem.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「The suspension bridge... Who would do such a thing...?」
＃Protagonist
「I expect it was the culprit...」
＃Tsujimura
「This is a predicament... Since there's no way we can repair the bridge ourselves...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Takamine
「...The culprit likely intends to increase the number of victims. Otherwise, there'd be no point in taking out the bridge.」
＃Protagonist
「...That might be true.」
＃Mikanagi
「Without the bridge, you won't be able to go home... Though after an incident like this, you might not be able to leave even if the police arrive.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Narumi
「Even without the bridge, we have plenty of food, so we'll be fine. ...Though Kirihara-san will have to give up on her cola.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... I'll let her know.」
