＃Protagonist
「Souko-san!!」
I burst into the eastern corridor and shouted at the top of my lungs.
The door to Souko-san's room was open.
There was no response from inside.
Could it be...
＃Narumi
「...There's no one in there.」
Narumi-san, who had caught up, said so.
＃Protagonist
「No one...?」
＃Narumi
「Yes... however, things have taken a bit of a strange turn.」
With that, Narumi-san entered the room.
I followed after her.
＃Protagonist
「Whoa...」
The walls were defiled with bright red paint.
It looked like some kind of text was written there.
＃Protagonist
「What is this...?」
＃Narumi
「I don't know. It was like this when I arrived...」
＃Protagonist
「A warning, perhaps...?」
That was how the sentences written on the wall could be interpreted.
＃Protagonist
「Do you know where Souko-san is?」
＃Narumi
「She seemed to be in the main hall for a while... but she disappeared before I knew it, so I came to her room to look for her.」
＃Protagonist
「...I'll go find her.」
I hoped it wasn't true, but the fact she wasn't appearing here now spoke volumes about the gravity of the situation.
＃Narumi
「Understood. ...Be careful.」
Seeing me off, I left Souko-san's room.
