#Main Character
"Souko-san!!"
I burst into the eastern corridor and shouted at the top of my lungs.
The door to Souko-san's room was open.
There was no response from inside.
Could it be...
#Narumi
"...There's no one in there."
Narumi-san, who had caught up, said so.
#Main Character
"No one...?"
#Narumi
"Yes... however, things have taken a bit of a strange turn."
With that, Narumi-san entered the room.
I followed after her.
#Main Character
"Whoa..."
The walls were defiled with bright red paint.
It looked like some kind of text was written there.
#Main Character
"What is this...?"
#Narumi
"I don't know. It was like this when I arrived..."
#Main Character
"A warning, perhaps...?"
That was how the sentences written on the wall could be interpreted.
#Main Character
"Do you know where Souko-san is?"
#Narumi
"She seemed to be in the main hall for a while... but she disappeared before I knew it, so I came to her room to look for her."
#Main Character
"...I'll go find her."
I hoped it wasn't true, but the fact she wasn't appearing here now spoke volumes about the gravity of the situation.
#Narumi
"Understood. ...Be careful."
Seeing me off, I left Souko-san's room.
