I returned to my room.
＃Souko
"Did something happen...?"
Souko-san was awake.
＃Protagonist
"Well, yeah... I heard some kind of noise."
＃Souko
"Noises happen all the time... honestly."
She flopped back down onto the bed.
＃Protagonist
"Wait, Souko-san, if you're awake, then please go back to your own room."
＃Souko
"Mmn... fine, I hear you."
Souko-san finally stood up.
＃Souko
"Was that noise from downstairs?"
＃Protagonist
"I think so... Tsujimura-san said it was a mountain spirit..."
＃Souko
"The 'Curse' again, perhaps?"
＃Protagonist
"Surely you're not... planning to investigate?"
＃Souko
"Of course not. I'm tired. If we do it, it'll be tomorrow."
＃Protagonist
"...Right."
I suppose I didn't have to worry about being dragged around anymore tonight.
＃Souko
"Well then, good night. I've already warmed up the bed for you."
With just those words, Souko-san left the room.
＃Protagonist
"...Guess I'll sleep."
It wasn't that I'd been expecting it or anything, but as I crawled under the covers and felt the lingering warmth of Souko-san's body, I finally drifted off to sleep.
