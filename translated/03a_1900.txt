"Souko-san!!"
I burst into the eastern corridor, shouting at the top of my lungs.
#Souko
"...I can hear you."
Souko-san stepped out of her room.
#Protagonist
"Ah... Souko-san, what happened?"
#Souko
"See for yourself."
Looking a bit weary, she beckoned me to look inside.
#Protagonist
"Whoa..."
The walls were stained with bright red paint.
It looked like words were written there.
#Souko
"It looks like a warning."
#Protagonist
"Is this... blood?"
#Souko
"It appears so. I wonder when they managed to do this..."
Souko-san crossed her arms and let out a sigh.
#Protagonist
"Weren't you in your room?"
#Souko
"I’ve been downstairs since about 6:00. Narumi-san found my door open and let me know..."
#Protagonist
"So someone must have slipped in while you were out..."
#Souko
"I’m sure I locked the door when I left, but..."
Souko-san tilted her head.
#Protagonist
"Who on earth would do something like this..."
#Souko
"It’s a message telling us not to meddle too much, I suppose. But for now..."
Souko-san let out a massive sigh.
#Souko
"The bigger problem is that I won't be able to sleep in this room."
#Protagonist
"There are empty rooms available, so shouldn't we ask if you can move to one of them?"
#Souko
"I already asked Narumi-san to take care of it, so that’s not an issue, but..."
#Protagonist
"Something else?"
#Souko
"...The culprit must be quite desperate."
#Protagonist
"Desperate?"
#Souko
"Don't you think? Going out of their way to pull a threat like this. It’s a clear sign telling us not to dig any deeper."
#Protagonist
"Don't tell me... are you being targeted, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"I don't think so. The culprit likely doesn't have that much room to breathe."
#Protagonist
"Still... please be careful, okay?"
#Souko
"I know. ...Thanks for worrying about me."
Tsujimura-san entered the room.
#Tsujimura
"Kirihara-sama, a new room has been prepared. Please follow me."
#Souko
"Yes, thank you. Take care of my luggage, please."
#Protagonist
"Me?"
Well, I suppose there isn't anyone else.
#Souko
"Of course you."
I picked up Souko-san’s luggage from the corner and left the room.
We walked down the corridor, following Tsujimura-san.
#Tsujimura
"There is an empty room on the west side. Please use that one."
#Protagonist
"Is it across from Benio-san’s room?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, that’s correct."
We entered the western corridor, and Tsujimura-san opened the first door on the right.
#Tsujimura
"The layout is almost identical."
