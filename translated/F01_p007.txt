"Takamine-san? He's quite a stern man, isn't he? He doesn't seem like a lawyer at all."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Maya
"Attorney Takamine's father was also the Nanatsuki family's legal counsel. He is very dedicated to his work."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Mr. Takamine has apparently been coming here since he was small, brought along by his father."
#Satoshi
"Is that so?"
#Benio
"Mr. Takamine? He is a man of few words... and the burn scars on his face look quite painful."
#Satoshi
"They do..."
#Tsujimura
"Mr. Takamine. He is here to witness the wedding today. As a lawyer, he's necessary for the contract signing."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Rokuyou
"Takamine-san? I hear his family has been legal counsel for the Nanatsuki for generations, but I haven't talked to him much."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"……I have nothing to say."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Mikanagi
"About Mr. Takamine? Just like me, his father seems to have been involved with this family."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"Mr. Takamine? I believe he would be in his room, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"Takamine-san? ...He has a scary face, doesn't he? To think a guy like that is a lawyer... you just never know with this world."
#Satoshi
"I-I suppose so..."
