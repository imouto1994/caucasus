"...There's no doubt that this was used to sever Rokuyou-san's head. With a handle this long, I imagine anyone could have done it."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Maya
"The axe... as for where it was kept, you would have to ask Tsujimura."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Is that the wood-chopping axe...? I believe Tsujimura-san usually uses it for the firewood..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"It would be difficult to pull fingerprints from a rough wooden handle like that. Besides, the police can't get here, and such a task is beyond us."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"An axe... Seiji-san was often using one to chop wood..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That is the axe for firewood... It is normally kept in the storage shed near the office, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...If that was used to take off a head, it must have made quite a racket... though I didn't hear a thing from where I was."
#Satoshi
"My room was directly above his, so I suppose that's why I was just barely able to hear it..."
#Mikanagi
"...Judging by the state of the remains, there's no question the cervical region was severed with an axe."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"...Isn't that the one Tsujimura-san uses for the firewood?"
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"We use the fireplaces here, you know. Tsujimura-san is always out there chopping wood for us."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
