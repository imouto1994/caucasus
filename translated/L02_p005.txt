"I wonder if Shion-san could really set up such an elaborate mechanism? It's not impossible, of course... but I think it would be difficult."
#Satoshi
"...True."
#Benio
"Shion would have no reason to kill my sister. Those two are very close... almost abnormally so."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Shion emerged from her room around noon. She should have been in the tower the entire time before that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Shion-kun was in her room the whole time, wasn't she? You should probably ask Tsujimura-san about that."
#Satoshi
"Right."
#Akane
"I believe Lady Shion was in her room the entire time."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Lady Shion? I'm pretty sure she was in her room... though come to think of it, it seemed like Lady Ai was with her..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
