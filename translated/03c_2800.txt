Everyone who had survived was gathered in the main hall.
#Tsujimura
"U-Um... I heard that Shion-ojousama has passed away..."
Tsujimura-san was the first to ask.
#Benio
"...Yes, it appears she committed suicide."
#Tsujimura
"How could this be..."
#Takamine
"...But why?"
#Benio
"That... we still don't know the reason."
#Takamine
"Is there no possibility of murder?"
#Protagonist
"...I believe it's unlikely."
#Maya
"No... Shion..."
#Benio
"However... it's possible Shion was involved in all the other crimes. That would explain why she took her own life."
#Takamine
"I don't think Shion-kun had any reason to commit murder, but..."
#Benio
"I can't say for certain. Only that it's the highest probability right now."
#Takamine
"But..."
#Narumi
"It's a little hard to believe... especially after seeing *that*."
Narumi-san cast a fleeting glance toward Maya-san.
#Protagonist
"Narumi-san... let's set that aside for now. For the time being, please consider Shion-san as the culprit."
#Narumi
"I see—"
I couldn't tell if Narumi-san understood our intention, but at the very least, she seemed to accept it for now.
#Benio
"...There is nothing more we can do. All that's left is to stay quiet in our rooms and wait for morning."
#Mikanagi
"...That would be for the best."
Dr. Mikanagi nodded.
#Tsujimura
"Um... and Shion-ojousama's remains...?"
#Mikanagi
"...They should be left as they are."
#Tsujimura
"I see... understood."
#Protagonist
"...Well then, let's head back to our rooms."
