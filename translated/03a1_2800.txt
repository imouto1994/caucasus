Everyone was gathered in the main hall.
I entered the room with Shion-san in tow.
＃Protagonist
「Sorry to keep you all waiting.」
＃Souko
「Did you figure it out?」
I gave a nod in response to Souko-san's question.
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... well, more or less.」
＃Benio
「I’d certainly like to hear it, then—this grand theory of yours.」
＃Protagonist
「It's really not that impressive, but...」
I scanned the room.
＃Protagonist
「...This whole incident started with the murder of Rokuyou-san. However—that was merely the trigger.」
＃Protagonist
「I think Ai-san’s murder makes that clear enough.」
＃Souko
「True... Benio-san was attacked as well, so it's obvious the culprit intended to keep increasing the body count.」
Souko-san nodded.
＃Protagonist
「Exactly. ...To be honest, there are other things to discuss, but let’s focus on these two incidents first.」
＃Benio
「...Fine. Continue.」
Benio-san urged me on.
＃Protagonist
「Well then... first, regarding Rokuyou-san’s murder. This will be mostly a review for us, but—」
Shion-san looked down.
＃Protagonist
「The incident occurred the night we arrived here, after the wedding. I woke up in the middle of the night to a noise coming from the first floor.」
＃Souko
「It was just past 2:00 AM, wasn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, that's right. I happened to be lying on the floor, so I noticed the sound coming from below.」
＃Benio
「Hmm... I’m curious why you were lying on the floor, but never mind that for now.」
＃Protagonist
「...At that exact time, the crime was taking place in Rokuyou-san’s room, which was directly beneath mine.」
＃Mikanagi
「Indeed... the estimated time of death matches that almost perfectly.」
＃Protagonist
「The culprit decapitated Rokuyou-san and hid the head. They did this because they believed that a person wouldn't truly stay dead unless they went that far.」
＃Souko
「...Even without going to such lengths, is it possible Rokuyou-san was already dead?」
＃Protagonist
「...I can’t be sure. Whether it was a blow to the head or strangulation—he might have only been unconscious at that point.」
＃Benio
「Wasn't the head hidden to conceal the cause of death?」
＃Protagonist
「In this situation, I don't think that would have mattered. The cause of death wouldn't have directly pointed to the killer anyway.」
＃Benio
「Hmm...」
＃Protagonist
「Getting back to the point. I went downstairs to investigate the noise. That's when I ran into Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes... that’s right... I was in the hall. I didn't notice any noise, however...」
＃Protagonist
「To get to the northern corridor where Rokuyou-san’s room is, you have to pass through the hall. We talked there for a while, but—」
＃Benio
「Anyone moving from another section would have been immediately obvious.」
＃Protagonist
「Exactly. Of course, it’s possible the culprit was hiding in Rokuyou-san’s room the whole time, but—」
＃Takamine
「Wait. Are you implying that I’m the culprit? My room is directly across from Rokuyou-kun’s.」
＃Protagonist
「It’s just a possibility. Besides, there was one other person in that section. That person was—」
＃Souko
「Wait a minute. How did you come to that conclusion?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Takamine
「No way—」
Everyone turned their gaze toward Shion-san at once.
＃Shion
「—!」
＃Takamine
「...But she was inside the coffin in the chapel, wasn't she? That lid is heavy; it’s far beyond Shion-kun’s strength—」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, exactly. Which means someone else opened it. And that person was—」
＃Benio
「Hold on. How does that follow?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Protagonist
「You realize it now, don't you? It was the victim, Rokuyou-san.」
＃Takamine
「...But why would he—」
＃Protagonist
「...Rokuyou-san had leverage over Shion-san. I don’t know what his ultimate goal was, but that night, Rokuyou-san threatened her.」
＃Protagonist
「The wedding was already set; why was he in such a rush? Or perhaps it was something that would have jeopardized the marriage itself.」
＃Benio
「...And what was it?」
＃Protagonist
「...That’s irrelevant right now. ...Regardless, Rokuyou-san, who was threatening Shion-san, was easily overpowered and killed.」
＃Protagonist
「He was likely caught off guard. He probably assumed Shion-san’s slender arms couldn't possibly do anything to him.」
＃Protagonist
「But she had one weapon at her disposal. This is the proof.」
＃Tsujimura
「That... seems a bit far-fetched, doesn't it...?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... is it...?」
＃Takamine
「Hair...?」
＃Protagonist
「Most likely... Shion-san wrapped her hair around Rokuyou-san’s neck. Strands of hair that appeared to have been torn out at that time were also found in the chapel.」
＃Souko
「So... the cause of death was strangulation?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know. Even she couldn't tell if he was dead at that moment. Isn't that right...?」
＃Shion
「Ye... Yes...」
Shion-san nodded while trembling.
＃Protagonist
「Now—here is where the real problem begins. Regarding Ai-san’s murder—」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san was found hanged in the attic room. If I had arrived just a little sooner, I might have been able to save her.」
＃Benio
「...It’s in the past. Don't dwell on it too much.」
＃Protagonist
「My apologies. ...However, I believe that was only a step in the process.」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san was found hanged in the attic room. However, I believe that was only a step in the process.」
＃Mikanagi
「A step in the process...?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes. I suspect the culprit intended to decapitate Ai-san afterward.」
＃Souko
「What do you mean by that?」
＃Protagonist
「It was... to recreate the same situation as Rokuyou-san’s murder.」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san was discovered in the attic room with her head severed. This was done to mirror the circumstances of Rokuyou-san’s death.」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san was discovered in her own room with her head severed. This was done to mirror the circumstances of Rokuyou-san’s death.」
＃Benio
「But wasn't the cause of death electrocution?」
＃Protagonist
「...Dr. Mikanagi said at the time that he couldn't be certain. Isn't that right?」
＃Mikanagi
「...Ah, yes. However... there's no logical reason to electrocute someone after their head has been cut off.」
＃Protagonist
「Exactly. ...It was truly a meaningless act.」
＃Souko
「What do you mean?」
＃Protagonist
「If I had to give it a reason—it was to create a misconception about the time of the crime.」
＃Benio
「I see... making it look like she died during the second blackout, when in reality, she had been decapitated long before that.」
＃Protagonist
「That way, the culprit could easily establish an alibi. It likely happened after the first blackout... right after I took Ai-san to her room.」
That’s why—if I hadn't taken Ai-san to her room, she might still be alive.
＃Protagonist
「...The reason for decapitating Ai-san was to recreate the same scene as Rokuyou-san’s murder.」
＃Benio
「...A copycat killer?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes. Copying the method—most likely to shift the blame. I believe it was important to make it seem like a string of murders committed by the same person.」
＃Protagonist
「Leaving the snowdrops by the body was also done to make it look identical to Rokuyou-san's case.」
＃Benio
「...But do you have definitive proof that the culprit is a different person?」
＃Protagonist
「...Shion-san had no reason to kill Ai-san. ...Well, I don't think the culprit had a direct reason to kill Ai-san either, but—」
＃Takamine
「Are you saying Ai-kun was killed for no reason at all?」
＃Protagonist
「It means she wasn't targeted as an individual. I understood that when I saw this.」
＃Maya
「I don't believe that has anything to do with it.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... is that so...?」
＃Maya
「And that is...?」
＃Protagonist
「The journal left behind by Kousei-san. Many things were written in here. Naturally—about all of you as well.」
I addressed Maya-san directly.
＃Maya
「About us...?」
＃Protagonist
「To be precise, Maya-san—about you. It seems you’ve been... quite busy with various things.」
＃Maya
「—!」
＃Protagonist
「I'll skip the details for now. However... it seems you are deeply involved in several matters known as the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'.」
＃Benio
「What does that mean...?」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, could you tell me about the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'?」
＃Benio
「A-Ah... First—'One: All heads of the Nanatsuki family die mysterious deaths.' 'Two: No males are born into the Nanatsuki family.'」
＃Benio
「'Three: The disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Four: The mansion is painted jet black.' 'Five: A massive flock of crows blankets the mansion.'」
＃Benio
「'Six: The matter of the "Nanatsuki Sacrifice".' 'Seven: The spirit of the sacrificed girl wanders the mansion.' ...That’s all of them, but are you saying Mother is involved...?」
＃Protagonist
「Not in all of them, of course. For instance, 'One: All heads of the Nanatsuki family die mysterious deaths'—Maya-san was only involved in some of those.」
＃Benio
「Don't tell me, Father—」
＃Maya
「—!」
＃Protagonist
「She might not have killed him with her own hands. But—it's highly probable she provided the trigger. ...Dr. Mikanagi.」
＃Mikanagi
「...Yes?」
＃Protagonist
「What kind of person... was your father?」
＃Mikanagi
「My father was... Maya-san's lover. And I was also—」
＃Maya
「Dr. Mikanagi!?」
＃Benio
「Don't be so unsightly, Mother. Do you really intend to keep hiding things at this late stage?」
Benio-san spoke with sharp intensity.
＃Benio
「Did you think we hadn't noticed? Father must have realized it as well.」
But—Benio-san probably hasn't realized it yet.
That she isn't actually Kousei-san's child.
＃Protagonist
「...I suppose so. And then—he took his own life. It could certainly be called a mysterious death. And the cause of it was—」
＃Benio
「That's enough. Next—Mother shouldn't have anything to do with this. The fact that no boys are born isn't exactly limited to her.」
＃Protagonist
「...That’s likely the influence of the Nanatsuki family’s inbreeding. ...Moving on, let’s go to 'Three: The disappearances in Nanatsuki Village'.」
＃Narumi
「That's...」
Narumi-san stole a glance at Akane-san.
＃Protagonist
「Kousei-san’s journal contained a very interesting entry. According to it, Maya-san was doing something in a hidden room underground—」
＃Maya
「...」
＃Protagonist
「We found skeletal remains there. That person was—」
＃Akane
「Please wait, I think... that's not right.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Akane
「Eh... me...?」
＃Protagonist
「Technically, no. However... the handkerchief found with the remains clearly had the embroidery 'Akari·M'.」
＃Akane
「Eh—」
＃Protagonist
「It is most likely... your sister, Akari Misono-san.」
＃Akane
「No... is that true...?」
＃Narumi
「There's no definitive proof, but... I think she's right.」
Narumi-san nodded as well.
＃Akane
「Sister...」
＃Protagonist
「—Maya-san, were you the one who drank Akari Misono-san’s blood?」
＃Maya
「—Whatever could you be talking about?」
With elegance.
Maya-san tilted her head in feigned wonder.
＃Maya
「This is the first I’ve heard of a hidden room underground. Surely one of my ancestors must have built it, don't you think?」
＃Protagonist
「So you have no intention of admitting it...?」
＃Maya
「How can I admit to something... for which I have no memory?」
＃Benio
「Stop this unsightly display, Mother!!」
＃Maya
「Even if you say that... without any evidence...」
＃Protagonist
「...So you’re saying Kousei-san’s journal alone isn't enough to convince you.」
＃Maya
「I could hardly be expected to be convinced by that.」
＃Protagonist
「I see. In that case—how about this?」
＃Maya
「How is that supposed to be evidence? I don't understand it at all.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... is that so...?」
＃Protagonist
「The massive collection of wigs in your room, Maya-san... weren't those made from hair taken from your female victims?」
＃Maya
「Wh... Where is there such proof...」
＃Protagonist
「Not a single strand of hair was left on Akari-san’s remains underground. No matter how you look at it, it’s too soon for hair to have completely decomposed—」
＃Protagonist
「You likely pulled the hair out by the roots from the corpse. That can be easily verified by examining the wigs.」
＃Protagonist
「Given the number of wigs, they must include hair from other victims besides Akari-san. These days, we can even determine blood types from hair—」
＃Maya
「B-But—」
＃Benio
「Give it up, Mother. No matter what you say—I believe the words Father left behind.」
＃Maya
「Benio!! You—you would believe that man over me, your own flesh and blood!?」
＃Benio
「What—? What do you mean by that!?」
＃Maya
「That man was not your father. Not just for you, but for Ai as well—」
＃Mikanagi
「Don't tell me, my father was—」
＃Maya
「That’s exactly right! Ufufu—that man was impotent. He was a pathetic excuse for a man, unfit to carry on the Nanatsuki bloodline.」
＃Benio
「Stop it! Even so... he is my father!」
＃Maya
「Fufufu... Aha, haha—it’s all his fault! He wouldn't even look at me... Yes, he didn't like the fact that I was growing old!」
＃Maya
「That’s why I simply put in the effort to become young again. Look at me... thanks to those girls, I’m still this beautiful.」
＃Maya
「Ufufu... I’m sure those girls are happy to have been of use to me!」
＃Akane
「Stop it!」
＃Souko
「—That’s quite enough.」
Souko-san walked over to Maya-san and made her sit in a chair.
＃Souko
「...Are you planning to continue?」
＃Protagonist
「That’s...」
＃Benio
「...Please continue. We’ve only covered three. Besides, there’s more than this, isn't there?」
＃Protagonist
「That's right... next is 'Four: The mansion is painted jet black,' but this was simple. It's essentially a tradition that has continued since the first generation.」
＃Benio
「...So it seems. Then next... 'Five: A massive flock of crows blankets the mansion'—」
＃Protagonist
「Based on everything so far, it’s easy to imagine. Crows gather around carrion—」
＃Souko
「...There have been many deaths here, since long ago.」
＃Protagonist
「Most likely... The next is 'Six: The matter of the "Nanatsuki Sacrifice"'... Kousei-san also left record of this in his journal.」
＃Akane
「...About my sister...?」
＃Protagonist
「...No, it was different from the women who went missing. The original 'Sacrifice' was a child of the Nanatsuki family who showed abnormalities.」
＃Protagonist
「They would be placed in a coffin and decapitated. It was likely deemed necessary to return the bloodline to normal, but...」
＃Benio
「...In the old days, I probably would have been killed too. Well, Mother would have been first.」
＃Protagonist
「By the way—Shion-san.」
＃Shion
「Ye-Yes...?」
＃Protagonist
「Have you heard anything about this 'Nanatsuki Sacrifice'?」
＃Shion
「Eh...?」
＃Protagonist
「I suspect the reason you believed a person wouldn't die unless their head was cut off stems from this story...」
＃Shion
「...That might be true. But... I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Shion
「I am so sorry...」
＃Protagonist
「There’s no need to apologize. Now, for the final one, 'Seven: The spirit of the sacrificed girl wanders the mansion'—this is the only one I didn't quite understand.」
＃Tsujimura
「Um, that is most likely... either the Madam or Shion-ojousama, I believe...」
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san... do you know something?」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, well... both the Madam and Shion-ojousama have a tendency toward sleepwalking, and they would occasionally wander the mansion.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so... Perhaps a guest or someone saw that and it became a rumor... No, but wait—」
These two are not related by blood.
If it was only one of them—Maya-san—then it could be dismissed as an abnormality within the Nanatsuki bloodline.
＃Protagonist
「...Tsujimura-san, you've been here for a long time, haven't you?」
＃Tsujimura
「E-Eh, yes...」
＃Protagonist
「In that case, surely you must have noticed Maya-san's atrocities?」
＃Tsujimura
「Th-That’s...」
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san. There was only one person who was truly a sleepwalker. That person was—」
Nanatsuki Maya
Nanatsuki Shion
＃Protagonist
「It was Maya-san, wasn't it?」
＃Tsujimura
「............」
Tsujimura-san didn't answer.
Wait... was I wrong...?
＃Protagonist
「Was it Shion-san...?」
＃Tsujimura
「Ye-Yes... that’s right. I spent a lot of time in the office, so Shion-ojousama would occasionally...」
＃Protagonist
「...In other words, Maya-san wasn't sleepwalking—she was seen wandering in search of blood. Is that right?」
＃Tsujimura
「That... might be the case...」
I see.
Tsujimura-san likely feels a sense of debt because she’s been paying for his daughter’s medical expenses.
That’s why even now, he’s trying to protect Maya-san.
＃Benio
「...Is this the end?」
Benio-san let the words slip.
＃Protagonist
「No... the real show starts now. The reason for Ai-san’s murder—we’ve finally reached that point.」
＃Benio
「The reason... Is it a problem with the Nanatsuki family?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes... No, rather than the family, it's about Maya-san personally. The culprit's goal was to make Maya-san taste despair.」
＃Protagonist
「Because the culprit—was trying to take revenge on her. Isn't that right—?」
Now—to deliver the finishing blow to the culprit.
＃Maya
「...Why on earth would I need to take revenge on myself?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Souko
「...Ai-san was a victim. Are you suggesting it was suicide?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Benio
「...Are you an idiot? Why should I be treated as the culprit after everything that’s happened?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Shion
「I... I did not kill Ai-oneesama too. Please believe me...」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Tsujimura
「I... I feel only gratitude toward the Madam; I have never once thought of revenge.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Benio
「...How could Rokuyou, who was the first to die, kill my sister? Think it through, you fool.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Takamine
「I would never resort to such a short-sighted method as revenge. What do you think I’m a lawyer for?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Mikanagi
「...I have no reason to seek revenge on Maya-san. ...Though I’ve found plenty of things I’d like to apologize for on my father’s behalf.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Akane
「No, revenge is... I only wanted to find out for sure what happened to my sister...」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Narumi
「...Why would I need to take revenge on the Madam? If that were the case, I wouldn't have been helping her look for things in the first place.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Souko
「Me, taking revenge on Maya-san? There would be no point in that.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what...?」
＃Takamine
「—This is a waste of time.」
Takamine-san stood up.
＃Takamine
「This is pointless. I'll be in my room until rescue arrives.」
＃Protagonist
「A-Ah, um—」
＃Benio
「...That’s probably for the best. I’ll do the same.」
Even Benio-san said that.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, please wait—」
＃Souko
「It's no use.」
Souko-san grabbed my shoulder.
I couldn't help but glare at her.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san—」
＃Souko
「No matter what you say now, nobody is going to believe you.」
＃Protagonist
「That’s—Souko-san!!」
＃Souko
「...Give it up.」
Leaving me with those words, Souko-san also left the room.
Where... what did I get wrong...?
＃Takamine
「—This is a waste of time.」
Takamine-san stood up.
＃Takamine
「This is pointless. I'll be in my room until rescue arrives.」
＃Protagonist
「A-Ah, um—」
＃Benio
「...That’s probably for the best. I’ll do the same.」
Even Benio-san said that.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, please wait—」
＃Souko
「It's no use.」
Souko-san grabbed my shoulder.
I couldn't help but glare at her.
＃Protagonist
「...There's still more.」
＃Souko
「What is?」
＃Protagonist
「The proof of your crime—」
＃Souko
「No matter what you say now, nobody is going to believe you.」
＃Protagonist
「That’s—Souko-san!!」
＃Souko
「...Give it up.」
Leaving me with those words, Souko-san also left the room.
Where... what did I get wrong...?
＃Souko
「Eh... trash...?」
＃Protagonist
「It was dropped at the scene where Ai-san was murdered. I thought it was just trash at first too. But—」
I pointed to the bandage wrapped around Souko-san’s finger.
＃Protagonist
「It's the tape used to secure a bandage. ...When Dr. Mikanagi first treated you, he secured the bandage with paper tape, didn't he?」
＃Mikanagi
「A-Ah, yes... that’s right.」
＃Protagonist
「But now, it’s secured by tying the ends. I first noticed that last night.」
＃Souko
「...You were even looking at things like that.」
Souko-san let out a self-deprecating chuckle.
＃Protagonist
「Of course, I’m sure you could make any number of excuses. But I believe the Souko-san I know wouldn't resort to such a pathetic display.」
＃Souko
「...You overestimate me.」
This time, she let out a clear, bitter laugh.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san... if it isn't you, won't you just say so, clearly...?」
I stared intently into Souko-san's eyes.
＃Souko
「...Can I ask just one thing?」
＃Protagonist
「...Go ahead.」
＃Souko
「The revenge I’m taking against Maya-san—what would be the reason for it?」
＃Protagonist
「...It’s likely what is written in here.」
＃Souko
「...Then this conversation is over.」
＃Protagonist
「That’s—Souko-san!!」
＃Souko
「...Give it up. That was just a piece of trash. I’m not admitting to anything.」
Leaving me with those words, Souko-san left the room.
Where... what did I get wrong...?
＃Protagonist
「...Marino Lische-san, who was pregnant with Kousei-san’s child, vanished from here. And several years later—she was burned to death by Maya-san.」
＃Souko
「—!」
＃Protagonist
「The child, who was rescued by Takamine-san over there, was taken to a hospital because of severe burns. Eventually—it seems they disappeared from there.」
＃Souko
「...You even knew about that.」
＃Protagonist
「Will you admit it...? Souko-san, no—Kanon-san.」
＃Souko
「That is not my name!!」
Suddenly—Souko-san moved.
She circled behind Maya-san, who was slumped nearby, and pressed a knife to her throat.
＃Maya
「Hi... Hiee...!」
＃Benio
「Mother!!」
＃Souko
「It’s a half-measure. If you realized I was the culprit, you should at least have kept her away from me—and so it comes to this.」
＃Protagonist
「Please stop this, Souko-san!!」
＃Souko
「—This is your fault. Because you talked too much—I have been forced to do this.」
Souko-san slowly backed toward the door.
＃Protagonist
「Where do you intend to go...?」
＃Benio
「There's nowhere to run. The bridge is still out. ...You were the one who destroyed it anyway, weren't you?」
＃Souko
「True... Dawn is about to break; shall we head outside?」
With that, Souko-san led Maya-san out into the corridor.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san!!」
As I started to run, Takamine-san grabbed my arm.
＃Takamine
「Wait. Don't provoke her further.」
＃Protagonist
「B-But—」
＃Takamine
「...To think she was that child...」
Takamine-san’s face twisted with regret.
＃Shion
「Um... let’s follow them.」
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...?」
＃Shion
「Kirihara-san is... Kanon-san, isn't she...? In that case, she is, um, my—」
＃Tsujimura
「...She would be your older sister, Shion-ojousama...」
＃Shion
「So it is true... after all...」
She must have realized it from the phonetic similarity of the names.
Shion-san looked down sadly.
＃Benio
「—Let’s go. Even if she is my mother, I cannot just leave her.」
Grabbed by the arm by Benio-san, we headed outside.
