"A photo of a foreign maid in Takamine-san's room, huh... I wonder who she is."
＃Protagonist
"No idea..."
＃Maya
"A foreign maid? ...No, there has never been such a person here."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"A foreigner... I don't recall anyone like that being here..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"A foreign maid? No, never heard of her... Maybe she was here before I was born..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"A foreign maid... I've never heard of one..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"A foreigner... There were a few in the past, but I can't say much from just that..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Marino... That's a name I haven't heard in a very long time..."
＃Protagonist
"You know her...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Yes... Lady Marino was the daughter of Lady Liesche, who was a friend of the Master. When Lady Liesche passed away in Japan, she entrusted her to the Master."
＃Protagonist
"...And that's how she came to work here?"
＃Tsujimura
"Since the Mistress had no children at the time, the Master intended to adopt her, but Lady Marino declined."
＃Protagonist
"That happened...? But why does Takamine-san have a photo of her...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Master Takamine used to stay here when he was brought along by his father... Perhaps they met back then..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Master Takamine used to stay here when he was brought along by his father... Perhaps they met back then..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"...Did you see the photo?"
＃Protagonist
"S-Sorry, I didn't mean to..."
＃Takamine
"...She is a German woman named Marino Liesche. She worked here before the war."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so... But why do you have a photo of someone like that, Takamine-san?"
＃Takamine
"...No need to prying."
＃Protagonist
"I-I understand..."
＃Takamine
"...Did you hear that from Tsujimura-san?"
＃Protagonist
"Y-Yeah... I just got curious... What kind of person was she...?"
＃Takamine
"...She was a woman who sang beautiful songs."
＃Protagonist
"Songs..."
＃Takamine
"I'm told her mother was also a famous singer in Germany. It seems talent is hereditary."
＃Protagonist
"Where is she now...?"
＃Takamine
"...She reportedly vanished about twenty years ago. Nothing is known of her whereabouts since."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"...No need for prying."
＃Protagonist
"I-I understand..."
＃Mikanagi
"A foreign maid... I've heard there was one before the war, but I don't know the details."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Oh... So there was a foreigner working here too..."
＃Protagonist
"Maybe..."
＃Narumi
"That's the photo in the lawyer's room, right? It's from a long time ago... Doesn't look like she was a girlfriend or anything."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
