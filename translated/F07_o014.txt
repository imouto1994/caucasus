"A photo of a foreign maid in Takamine-san's room, huh... I wonder who she is."
#Satoshi
"No idea..."
#Maya
"A foreign maid? ...No, there has never been such a person here."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"A foreigner... I don't recall anyone like that being here..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"A foreign maid? No, never heard of her... Maybe she was here before I was born..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"A foreign maid... I've never heard of one..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"A foreigner... There were a few in the past, but I can't say much from just that..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Marino... That's a name I haven't heard in a very long time..."
#Satoshi
"You know her...?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes... Lady Marino was the daughter of Lady Liesche, who was a friend of the Master. When Lady Liesche passed away in Japan, she entrusted her to the Master."
#Satoshi
"...And that's how she came to work here?"
#Tsujimura
"Since the Mistress had no children at the time, the Master intended to adopt her, but Lady Marino declined."
#Satoshi
"That happened...? But why does Takamine-san have a photo of her...?"
#Tsujimura
"Master Takamine used to stay here when he was brought along by his father... Perhaps they met back then..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Master Takamine used to stay here when he was brought along by his father... Perhaps they met back then..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...Did you see the photo?"
#Satoshi
"S-Sorry, I didn't mean to..."
#Takamine
"...She is a German woman named Marino Liesche. She worked here before the war."
#Satoshi
"Is that so... But why do you have a photo of someone like that, Takamine-san?"
#Takamine
"...No need to prying."
#Satoshi
"I-I understand..."
#Takamine
"...Did you hear that from Tsujimura-san?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah... I just got curious... What kind of person was she...?"
#Takamine
"...She was a woman who sang beautiful songs."
#Satoshi
"Songs..."
#Takamine
"I'm told her mother was also a famous singer in Germany. It seems talent is hereditary."
#Satoshi
"Where is she now...?"
#Takamine
"...She reportedly vanished about twenty years ago. Nothing is known of her whereabouts since."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...No need for prying."
#Satoshi
"I-I understand..."
#Mikanagi
"A foreign maid... I've heard there was one before the war, but I don't know the details."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Oh... So there was a foreigner working here too..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe..."
#Narumi
"That's the photo in the lawyer's room, right? It's from a long time ago... Doesn't look like she was a girlfriend or anything."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
