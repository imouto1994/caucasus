We followed Tsujimura-san and arrived at the door to Rokuyou-san’s room.
#Tsujimura
"It’s still locked."
Tsujimura-san knocked on the door.
#Tsujimura
"Rokuyou-sama, have you not woken up yet?"
#Benio
"What's it like inside?"
Benio-san asked as she caught up with us.
#Tsujimura
"I can't tell. Perhaps he is still asleep..."
#Souko
"Don't you have a spare key?"
#Tsujimura
"There is one in the office, but..."
#Souko
"It’s probably best to open it."
#Tsujimura
"...Very well. Please wait here for a moment."
Tsujimura-san left the door and headed back down the hallway.
#Benio
"...I wonder what's going on."
Benio-san whispered.
#Protagonist
"Yeah. Even if he were asleep, it’s strange that he wouldn't come out after all this..."
#Souko
"What about last night? Did anyone see him?"
#Benio
"I only saw him immediately following the ceremony."
#Souko
"...If he’s not in this room, then..."
At Souko-san’s words, I reflexively looked toward the door at the very end of the corridor.
#Benio
"Don't be ridiculous. Shion is in there, and the door is locked."
#Souko
"...It certainly seems that way."
Souko-san nodded, her hand on the knob of the chapel door.
#Souko
"Hey, could you go ask Tsujimura-san to bring the chapel key as well?"
#Protagonist
"Me?"
#Souko
"Obviously."
Well, I guess so.
#Protagonist
"Fine, I'm going."
I left the group for a moment.
