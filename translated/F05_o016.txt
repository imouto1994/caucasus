"'Akane' and 'Akari', huh... I could understand other things, but I don't think anyone would mistake their own name..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Maya
"...I am sorry, I do not quite understand."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"...I'm sorry, I don't really know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"Isn't it strange to use 'M' as the initial for 'Hiyama'? If you made that many mistakes, you'd notice, and normally you'd just start over."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
＃Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Mistakes can happen... for example, Lady Benio spells her name 'Venio' in Romaji."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I'm not really sure."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"...I'm sorry, but I really don't know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"...That handkerchief from yesterday, right?"
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san said she made a mistake, but I don't think that's it. Who on earth is 'Akari M.'...?"
＃Mikanagi
"...I know of one person with a name that matches."
＃Protagonist
"...The person in the photo in your room?"
＃Mikanagi
"...So you saw it."
＃Protagonist
"...I'm sorry."
＃Mikanagi
"There's no need to apologize. I was the one who sent you to get my bag, after all."
＃Protagonist
"So... is it her?"
＃Mikanagi
"...She is Akari Misono, the person most precious to me."
＃Protagonist
"Was she someone who worked here?"
＃Mikanagi
"...Until a short while ago, yes."
＃Protagonist
"But even if it's her... why would Akane-san have..."
＃Mikanagi
"...It would be best to ask Akane-san about that. Besides, it's not certain that the embroidery on the handkerchief refers to her in the first place."
＃Protagonist
"Right... I understand."
＃Akane
"I-I told you yesterday, I just made a mistake...!"
＃Protagonist
"I-Is that so..."
＃Akane
"About that... I'm sorry, could you ask me later...?"
＃Protagonist
"I see... understood."
＃Narumi
"...I don't think that girl can even embroider... I wonder if she really sewed it herself?"
＃Protagonist
"I wonder..."
