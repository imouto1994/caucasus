When I entered the main hall with the now-changed Benio-san, Ai-san, who was sitting on the sofa, looked up.
＃Ai
「Good morning.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Ai-san. Were you able to sleep last night?」
＃Ai
「Yes, thanks to you.」
Ai-san bowed her head.
＃Benio
「Is it okay for you to be out here?」
＃Ai
「...If I stay cooped up in my room alone, I just end up feeling depressed.」
Ai-san managed a smile.
＃Ai
「I'll make some cocoa.」
＃Protagonist
「Thank you.」
Almost as soon as Ai-san stood up, Narumi-san entered the hall.
I arrived at the main hall with the now-changed Benio-san.
＃Benio
「Do you want some cocoa?」
Benio-san asked me.
＃Protagonist
「Yeah.」
＃Benio
「Wait a second.」
Almost as soon as Benio-san walked to the corner of the room, Narumi-san entered the hall.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, good morning.」
＃Narumi
「Morning. I've brought breakfast.」
Narumi-san pushed in a cart lined with sandwiches.
＃Souko
「Can I have some?」
Souko-san, who followed them in, poked her head out.
＃Narumi
「Go ahead. ...Well, if anyone doesn't want to eat, I won't force them.」
With that, Narumi-san shot a dangerous look at Lawyer Takamine, who was in the corner of the room.
＃Takamine
「Hmph...」
＃Souko
「It's a waste, they're so delicious.」
Souko-san was munching on a sandwich, seemingly without a care in the world.
＃Protagonist
「...Souko-san, what's in that bag?」
I noticed the bag Souko-san was carrying.
＃Souko
「Empty cola bottles. They were piling up in my room, so I thought I'd throw them away.」
＃Narumi
「Then I'll take them. I'll throw them out in the kitchen.」
Narumi-san took the empty bottles.
＃Souko
「Thanks, I appreciate it.」
＃Protagonist
「Well then... I'll have some as well.」
With a polite word, I took a piece of sandwich.
It had boiled egg inside.
＃Benio
「And my sister?」
Benio-san asked Ai-san.
＃Ai
「I... don't really have much of an appetite yet.」
＃Benio
「I see. It's best not to push yourself.」
The cocoa Ai-san made was placed in front of me.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, thank you.」
＃Ai
「It's nothing...」
The cocoa Benio-san made was placed in front of me.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, thank you.」
＃Benio
「Don't mention it.」
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san and Shion-san entered.
＃Protagonist
「Good morning.」
＃Tsujimura
「Good morning, everyone.」
After exchanging greetings with Tsujimura-san, I stole a glance at Shion-san.
＃Shion
「............」
She looked unwell.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...?」
＃Shion
「Ah, yes... what is it...?」
＃Protagonist
「You don't look very well...」
＃Shion
「Yes... I'm feeling a little under the weather...」
＃Souko
「Are you okay...?」
＃Benio
「Shion, can you manage some breakfast?」
＃Shion
「Yes...」
Shion-san gave a small nod and picked up a sandwich.
＃Benio
「Tsujimura, why don't you eat something too?」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, I think I will.」
The door opened, and Dr. Mikanagi entered.
＃Mikanagi
「It seems everyone is here.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Dr. Mikanagi.」
＃Mikanagi
「Good morning. Madam isn't feeling well and is resting in her room, so could someone bring her some food later?」
＃Narumi
「Yes, I understand.」
＃Souko
「Is she going to be alright?」
Souko-san asked with concern.
＃Mikanagi
「...It might be the strain. A lot happened yesterday alone.」
＃Benio
「Well... it can't be helped. Mother has never been particularly strong.」
＃Protagonist
「...I hope we can be released soon.」
Some people will surely start to find this confinement unbearable before long.
Before we reach our limit, I have to find the culprit somehow and put everyone's mind at ease.
＃Souko
「...Don't put too much pressure on yourself.」
Souko-san muttered as she sipped her cola.
