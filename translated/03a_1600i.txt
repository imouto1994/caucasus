I suppose this is enough.
＃Souko
「...In the end, we didn't gain much.」
＃Protagonist
「...I'll try asking Benio-san for more details later.」
That's right.
At the very least, I was able to save Benio-san when she was in danger.
＃Souko
「...At this stage, who do you think the culprit is?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... me?」
＃Protagonist
「...There's the possibility it's you, Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「Me? Why?」
＃Protagonist
「Hey, don't get mad. I know you have no motive and it's not you.」
＃Souko
「I see. I don't have an alibi either, after all.」
＃Protagonist
「Well... that's how it is.」
I'd said it right to her face, which made things very awkward.
＃Souko
「It's not bad to suspect those close to you first. As long as you have a proper reason.」
Souko-san laughed and patted my shoulder.
＃Protagonist
「Maybe... it's Benio-san herself.」
＃Souko
「...You mean she staged it?」
＃Protagonist
「It's just a possibility. If she makes it look like she was attacked, she'd be cleared of suspicion, right?」
＃Souko
「...That would explain why the culprit vanished... but it's dangerous to jump to conclusions.」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah, I know.」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Maya-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「...Honestly, I don't know. Maya-san is always in her room... but Benio-san is her own daughter, right?」
＃Protagonist
「...That's the thing... but if inheritance is involved...」
＃Souko
「Killing her own daughter... do you think so?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know. I have no proof at all.」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Ai-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「That's impossible. She's already dead.」
＃Protagonist
「...Right.」
I saw the dead Ai-san with my own eyes.
There's no way she's moving around.
＃Souko
「Ai-san? ...But she's dead.」
＃Protagonist
「But... there's no proof that body was Ai-san... it didn't have a head.」
＃Souko
「Then who do you think it was?」
＃Protagonist
「I... I don't know, but...」
＃Souko
「That's a tough one. If you want to push that theory, you have to identify exactly whose body that was.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Souko
「Ai-san? But she's a victim too, isn't she?」
＃Protagonist
「...She might have faked it.」
＃Souko
「Hmm... it's not a zero percent chance, but I think it would be difficult.」
＃Protagonist
「You think so...?」
＃Souko
「Let's keep it in mind for now.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Shion-san is the culprit...?」
＃Souko
「...I wonder. I don't think she has that kind of nerve, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Still... I don't think it's impossible.」
＃Souko
「...Maybe so. We should keep an eye on her... but try not to provoke her unnecessarily.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I know.」
＃Protagonist
「What about Tsujimura-san?」
＃Souko
「...I see. He's the late head's younger brother, and he manages the master keys... it wouldn't be impossible for him to pull off everything so far...」
＃Protagonist
「But... he just doesn't look the part. And I can't imagine he holds a grudge against Benio-san...」
＃Souko
「People don't only kill out of grudges. But well, we have no evidence, so we can't exactly interrogate him.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Protagonist
「...There's no way Rokuyou-san is the culprit, right?」
＃Souko
「I doubt it. But... since we only confirmed a headless body... I can't say for sure that he wasn't swapped out.」
＃Protagonist
「...If only there was an extra body somewhere...」
＃Souko
「Things wouldn't be that convenient, now would they?」
＃Protagonist
「T-True...」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Takamine-san is the culprit...?」
＃Souko
「...Honestly, I don't know with that man. I feel like he's hiding something, but...」
＃Protagonist
「We don't have anything like evidence, but should we be cautious?」
＃Souko
「Right... it's better than doing nothing.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Dr. Mikanagi is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「The doctor? ...Well, I suppose if he's doing the autopsies himself, he could fake whatever he wanted...」
＃Protagonist
「Exactly.」
＃Souko
「But then most of what we've investigated so far would become meaningless. Even the estimated times of death.」
＃Protagonist
「That... would be a problem...」
＃Souko
「We can't investigate it ourselves, so we just have to trust him, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Protagonist
「Is it possible Akane-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「Did she do something suspicious?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... she's been acting strange since last night...」
＃Souko
「I see... we might need to keep a close watch on her.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... right.」
＃Souko
「...I suppose that would explain why she went into hiding...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Protagonist
「...Maybe Narumi-san is the culprit.」
＃Souko
「Did you see something?」
＃Protagonist
「No... not exactly...」
I should probably keep the fact that she's a thief to myself for now.
＃Souko
「It's best not to suspect people without cause, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Souko
「...We don't have any solid leads yet.」
＃Protagonist
「...It's not good to decide on a culprit based on speculation alone.」
＃Souko
「Exactly. We have to find definitive proof.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I know. But... to find proof, something else has to happen, doesn't it...?」
＃Souko
「...I don't think this will end with what happened today. We still haven't grasped the culprit's motive.」
Souko-san muttered with a grave expression.
