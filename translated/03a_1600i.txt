I suppose this is enough.
#Souko
"...In the end, we didn't gain much."
#Main Character
"...I'll try asking Benio-san for more details later."
That's right.
At the very least, I was able to save Benio-san when she was in danger.
#Souko
"...At this stage, who do you think the culprit is?"
#Main Character
"Eh... me?"
#Main Character
"...There's the possibility it's you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Me? Why?"
#Main Character
"Hey, don't get mad. I know you have no motive and it's not you."
#Souko
"I see. I don't have an alibi either, after all."
#Main Character
"Well... that's how it is."
I'd said it right to her face, which made things very awkward.
#Souko
"It's not bad to suspect those close to you first. As long as you have a proper reason."
Souko-san laughed and patted my shoulder.
#Main Character
"Maybe... it's Benio-san herself."
#Souko
"...You mean she staged it?"
#Main Character
"It's just a possibility. If she makes it look like she was attacked, she'd be cleared of suspicion, right?"
#Souko
"...That would explain why the culprit vanished... but it's dangerous to jump to conclusions."
#Main Character
"...Yeah, I know."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Maya-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"...Honestly, I don't know. Maya-san is always in her room... but Benio-san is her own daughter, right?"
#Main Character
"...That's the thing... but if inheritance is involved..."
#Souko
"Killing her own daughter... do you think so?"
#Main Character
"I don't know. I have no proof at all."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Ai-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"That's impossible. She's already dead."
#Main Character
"...Right."
I saw the dead Ai-san with my own eyes.
There's no way she's moving around.
#Souko
"Ai-san? ...But she's dead."
#Main Character
"But... there's no proof that body was Ai-san... it didn't have a head."
#Souko
"Then who do you think it was?"
#Main Character
"I... I don't know, but..."
#Souko
"That's a tough one. If you want to push that theory, you have to identify exactly whose body that was."
#Main Character
"...You're right."
#Souko
"Ai-san? But she's a victim too, isn't she?"
#Main Character
"...She might have faked it."
#Souko
"Hmm... it's not a zero percent chance, but I think it would be difficult."
#Main Character
"You think so...?"
#Souko
"Let's keep it in mind for now."
#Main Character
"Understood."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Shion-san is the culprit...?"
#Souko
"...I wonder. I don't think she has that kind of nerve, but..."
#Main Character
"Still... I don't think it's impossible."
#Souko
"...Maybe so. We should keep an eye on her... but try not to provoke her unnecessarily."
#Main Character
"Yeah... I know."
#Main Character
"What about Tsujimura-san?"
#Souko
"...I see. He's the late head's younger brother, and he manages the master keys... it wouldn't be impossible for him to pull off everything so far..."
#Main Character
"But... he just doesn't look the part. And I can't imagine he holds a grudge against Benio-san..."
#Souko
"People don't only kill out of grudges. But well, we have no evidence, so we can't exactly interrogate him."
#Main Character
"True..."
#Main Character
"...There's no way Rokuyou-san is the culprit, right?"
#Souko
"I doubt it. But... since we only confirmed a headless body... I can't say for sure that he wasn't swapped out."
#Main Character
"...If only there was an extra body somewhere..."
#Souko
"Things wouldn't be that convenient, now would they?"
#Main Character
"T-True..."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Takamine-san is the culprit...?"
#Souko
"...Honestly, I don't know with that man. I feel like he's hiding something, but..."
#Main Character
"We don't have anything like evidence, but should we be cautious?"
#Souko
"Right... it's better than doing nothing."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Dr. Mikanagi is the culprit?"
#Souko
"The doctor? ...Well, I suppose if he's doing the autopsies himself, he could fake whatever he wanted..."
#Main Character
"Exactly."
#Souko
"But then most of what we've investigated so far would become meaningless. Even the estimated times of death."
#Main Character
"That... would be a problem..."
#Souko
"We can't investigate it ourselves, so we just have to trust him, but..."
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
#Main Character
"Is it possible Akane-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"Did she do something suspicious?"
#Main Character
"Well... she's been acting strange since last night..."
#Souko
"I see... we might need to keep a close watch on her."
#Main Character
"Yeah... right."
#Souko
"...I suppose that would explain why she went into hiding..."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"...Maybe Narumi-san is the culprit."
#Souko
"Did you see something?"
#Main Character
"No... not exactly..."
I should probably keep the fact that she's a thief to myself for now.
#Souko
"It's best not to suspect people without cause, but..."
#Main Character
"...You're right."
#Souko
"...We don't have any solid leads yet."
#Main Character
"...It's not good to decide on a culprit based on speculation alone."
#Souko
"Exactly. We have to find definitive proof."
#Main Character
"Yeah... I know. But... to find proof, something else has to happen, doesn't it...?"
#Souko
"...I don't think this will end with what happened today. We still haven't grasped the culprit's motive."
Souko-san muttered with a grave expression.
