There's a door that looks like a back entrance.
It looks cold out there, so I didn't feel like going out at all.
It seems to be a back entrance.
Ladles and rice paddles are hanging on the wall.
Cooking utensils are suspended from the wall.
It looks like a furnace for cooking rice.
It tastes better than an electric rice cooker...
It seems to be a gas-powered furnace.
It's an incredibly large kiln.
It seems to be a wood-fired oven.
Probably because they make so much food...
A table is placed in the center.
They probably do the food prep here.
A large prep table is in the center.
There's a tap attached.
The area around the sink is quite clean...
The tap water looks cold and delicious.
When I aimlessly opened the lid of the trash can, I found a pretty card inside.

"What's this...?"
The card had the letter 'i' written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll hold onto it.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and answer the question! The response section on the survey postcard was meant for this!"

"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I'm a little curious, so I'll hold onto this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Now all the cards have been collected! As for the question you're wondering about... if you rearrange the letters so far, they'll form a certain word."
"Answer with a Japanese translation appropriate for this work and send in the survey postcard!"
"Deadline: Postmarked by January 11, 2010! 10 winners chosen by lottery will receive a small gift!"

"...I see."
I kind of get it, but also not really...
It's just an ordinary trash can.
Lots of tableware are lined up.
I'm too terrified to even go near them.
It'd be a disaster if I broke even one...
It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
The wind and snow seem to be getting stronger than they were this evening.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
