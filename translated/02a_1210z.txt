I think I’ve seen enough.
＃Protagonist
「Is this sufficient?」
I asked Souko-san.
＃Souko
「If you say it’s enough, then I suppose it is.」
＃Protagonist
「It makes me a little uneasy when you put it like that...」
[Keep investigating]
[I’ve seen enough]
Maybe I should look a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I’ve searched every corner.
＃Protagonist
「I think that’s everything.」
＃Souko
「Alright, then it’s time to do some questioning. Everyone should be gathered in the Great Hall by now.」
＃Protagonist
「...We should probably seal this room off too, shouldn't we?」
＃Souko
「We’ll ask Tsujimura-san to handle that later.」
We climbed down the ladder to the second floor.
＃Souko
「Well then, shall we head to the Great Hall?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah.」
