This is Mikanagi-sensei's room.
I give the door a light knock.
#Mikanagi
"Ah... it's you. Good morning."
#Protagonist
"Good morning, Mikanagi-sensei. Do you have a moment?"
#Mikanagi
"I’m sorry... but if you have business, could we do it later in the infirmary? I'm still sleepy."
#Protagonist
"Oh... sorry about that. I'll see you later then."
#Mikanagi
"Yes, please do."
Mikanagi-sensei looked incredibly sleepy.
Maybe he's just not a morning person.
I can't just stand around here forever, so let's try somewhere else.
I’ve come to the front of Mikanagi-sensei's room.
Just as I was about to knock, I remembered.
He said if I had business, to see him in the infirmary.
I should wait a while and then head to the infirmary.
I decided to leave the area.
I’ve come to the front of Mikanagi-sensei's room.
I give the door a light knock.
#Protagonist
"Huh... I guess he's not here."
There was no response no matter how long I waited.
Nothing for it; let's try somewhere else.
