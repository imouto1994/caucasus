Is this... an organ?
I don't really know the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it's clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play it for a second, but it's probably not good to touch things without permission.
It appears to be an organ.
There's sheet music sitting on the desk.
It looks like something Kousei-san was writing.
I don't really understand it, but it might be something valuable.
The title is... "Three Fragments," maybe?
It seems to be a piece titled "Three Fragments."
It looks like sheet music is stored inside the glass cabinet.
There are works by composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach.
A lot of sheet music is stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
It's likely something Kousei-san used.
I've already searched here, so let's look somewhere else.
Sheet music is pasted on the wall.
It was probably composed by Kousei-san.
Sheet music is pasted on the wall.
It's pure white outside; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
A book has been left sitting on the music stand.
It makes it feel as if Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer, there was blank manuscript paper.
A small piece of wood is placed on top as a paperweight.
I wonder what this is... It looks like a fragment of marquetry.

Unused manuscript paper is stored here.
It looks like a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's probably a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.
