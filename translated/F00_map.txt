#Benio
"—Hey."
Benio-san suddenly called out to us, and we came to a stop.
#Narumi
"Lady Benio..."
#Benio
"Everyone's on edge. Don't wander around the mansion too much."
#Protagonist
"We were just investigating the cipher..."
#Benio
"I know that, but stop for now. I can't relax with someone walking up and down the halls in the middle of the night."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"...I guess we have to give up for now."
#Protagonist
"In that case... I'm going to go see Shion-san."
#Narumi
"Lady Shion? Did you think of something?"
#Protagonist
"Just a little... I don't have any proof, though."
#Narumi
"...I see. Be careful."
#Protagonist
"...Yeah."
