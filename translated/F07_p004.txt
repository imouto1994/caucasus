「If you're looking for Benio-san, she should be in the infirmary... but her life isn't in danger, so you can relax.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Souko
「To think even Benio-san would be murdered... the pool of victims and suspects is finally starting to narrow down...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Maya
「As for Benio... I don't want her getting involved in anything dangerous...」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」

＃Protagonist
「Maya-san...」
＃Ai
「...As I feared, Benio was targeted as well... Why did it come to this...」

＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
＃Shion
「Lady Benio... is she going to be all right...?」

＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...」

「...I don't know.」
＃Takamine
「So Benio-kun pulled through... but we can't let our guard down just yet.」

＃Protagonist
「Y-Yeah...」
＃Mikanagi
「I'm having Benio-san rest in the infirmary for now.」

＃Mikanagi
「To think Benio-san would be murdered too... I don't want to think it's over an inheritance dispute, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Akane
「Lady Benio is resting in the infirmary.」

「True...」
＃Narumi
「...With Lady Benio murdered as well, have you grasped the killer's intent even a little?」
＃Protagonist
「No... not yet.」
