"Hello, Mikanagi-sensei."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, what is it?"
#Satoshi
"Um... could I have a moment of your time?"
#Mikanagi
"I don't mind."
Now then, what should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Oh, what is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"Could I have a moment of your time?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, go ahead."
Now then, what should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's back in his room.
In that case, there's no point in staying here...
What should I do?
