＃Protagonist
「Hello, Mikanagi-sensei.」
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Um... could I have a moment of your time?」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't mind.」
Now then, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Could I have a moment of your time?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, go ahead.」
Now then, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's back in his room.
In that case, there's no point in staying here...
What should I do?
