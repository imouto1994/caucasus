「Want to hear about Cola? Well, you know, I was the first person in Japan to ever drink it. Pretty impressive, right?」

「Cola... is it. Unfortunately, I have never had the occasion to drink it.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Ai
「Cola? I have heard of it... that is what Kirihara-san was drinking, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, that's right.」
＃Benio
「I am familiar with Cola. I often drink it when I go into town.」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, is that so?」
＃Tsujimura
「Cola, is it... I remember receiving some from the Occupation forces long ago. That was nearly twenty years ago, though...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Rokuyou

＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「Cola? I don't drink such things.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
＃Mikanagi

＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
＃Akane
「Cola? ...I'm sorry, we haven't prepared any here, but...」

「Cola? ...Actually, I heard that stewing chicken in Cola makes it quite delicious.」
＃Protagonist
「...Don't ask me, ask Souko-san.」
