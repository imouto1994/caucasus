"Want to hear about Cola? Well, you know, I was the first person in Japan to ever drink it. Pretty impressive, right?"
#Satoshi
"...I can tell that's a lie even without checking."
#Maya
"Cola... is it. Unfortunately, I have never had the occasion to drink it."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"Cola? I have heard of it... that is what Kirihara-san was drinking, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's right."
#Benio
"I am familiar with Cola. I often drink it when I go into town."
#Satoshi
"Oh, is that so?"
#Tsujimura
"Cola, is it... I remember receiving some from the Occupation forces long ago. That was nearly twenty years ago, though..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Rokuyou
"Cola, you say? Of course I like it. I always make sure to load a few bottles whenever I board a ship."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"Cola? I don't drink such things."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Cola contains a lot of caffeine, you see. If you drink too much, you might find yourself unable to sleep, so you should be careful."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Akane
"Cola? ...I'm sorry, we haven't prepared any here, but..."
#Satoshi
"Oh, no, it's fine. Souko-san brought plenty with her."
#Narumi
"Cola? ...Actually, I heard that stewing chicken in Cola makes it quite delicious."
#Satoshi
"...Don't ask me, ask Souko-san."
