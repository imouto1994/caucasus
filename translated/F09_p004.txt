"Benio-san seems to be looking into various things as well. She was injured, so I wish she wouldn't push herself..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"To think even Benio-san would be murdered... the pool of victims and suspects is finally starting to narrow down..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Maya
"As for Benio... I don't want her getting involved in anything dangerous..."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Maya
"Why Benio too...? That's why I told her to stop this dangerous business..."
#Satoshi
"Maya-san..."
#Ai
"...As I feared, Benio was targeted as well... Why did it come to this..."
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Ai
"Ah... Benio...! Why, why did you have to die...!!"
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
#Benio
"My condition is fine, don't worry about it."
#Satoshi
"Please don't push yourself too hard..."
#Shion
"Lady Benio... is she going to be all right...?"
#Satoshi
"She's just resting as a precaution for now. There's no need to worry."
#Shion
"Lady Benio... why...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Tsujimura
"...At any rate, I am relieved that Lady Benio is safe."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Tsujimura
"With Lady Benio gone as well... what will become of us now...?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know."
#Takamine
"So Benio-kun pulled through... but we can't let our guard down just yet."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Takamine
"Even Benio-kun was killed... Hurry up and drag the killer out."
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah..."
#Mikanagi
"Benio-san should be fine now. Though, it's probably best not to let her overexert herself."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"To think Benio-san would be murdered too... I don't want to think it's over an inheritance dispute, but..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Akane
"If it's Lady Benio, she should be in her room."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Lady Benio... why did she have to be murdered...?"
#Satoshi
"Akane-san..."
#Narumi
"The person who attacked Lady Benio, huh... it'd be best to ask the Lady herself, but..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Narumi
"...With Lady Benio murdered as well, have you grasped the killer's intent even a little?"
#Satoshi
"No... not yet."
