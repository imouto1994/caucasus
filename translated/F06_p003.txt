＃Souko
「...She seems quite shaken up.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Souko
「If Ai-san’s murder was related to the inheritance, the survivor would be the prime suspect... but I don't think it's that simple.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「I'm glad Ai was safe, but... why did something like this happen...?」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「Why Ai too...? Are you saying that child did something wrong...?」
＃Protagonist
「Maya-san...」
＃Ai
「...It seems I can't shake this fatigue... It’s strange, isn't it? Even though I’m in my own home...」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
＃Benio
「I have a feeling that attack on my sister was carried out differently than the one on Rokuyou...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「...I don't think it will end with my sister being killed. Next will be me... or someone else.」
＃Protagonist
「That might be true...」
＃Tsujimura
「Lady Ai seems quite shaken. I suppose it's only natural after something like that...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Tsujimura
「...Why did Lady Ai have to be killed...?」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Takamine
「...In any case, I'm glad Ai-kun didn't lose her life.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Takamine
「...So even Ai-kun was killed...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Mikanagi
「As for Ai-san, I expect she's returned to her room. After what happened yesterday, it's better if she rests.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「What is the culprit's aim...? What do they gain by killing Isamu and Ai-san...?」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
