「About Mikanagi-sensei? Hmm, he did treat my finger, but how should I put it... he seems a bit flighty.」
＃Protagonist
「...I suppose so.」
＃Maya
「We owe Mikanagi-sensei's father a great debt. I am who I am today thanks to the Mikanagi family.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Ai
「Mikanagi-sensei looks after us often. Since other doctors won't come out to such a remote place, he's a lifesaver.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Benio
「You mean the Good Doctor? Well, he might look serious, but he's a frivolous man.」
＃Protagonist
「...Oh.」
＃Tsujimura
「Mikanagi-sensei is indispensable to this house. Neither the Mistress nor Lady Shion are particularly robust...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「Mikanagi-sensei seems to be an excellent physician. His specialty is internal medicine, but I imagine he could handle simple surgery.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「Me? My father is the true family physician for the Nanatsuki. But he's getting on in years, so I've been staying here lately.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so?」
＃Akane
「U-um... about last night... did you tell anyone...?」
＃Protagonist
「...No, I haven't told anyone yet.」
＃Akane
「Please, you absolutely mustn't tell a soul, okay!?」
＃Protagonist
「Sure... I get it...」
＃Narumi
「Mikanagi-sensei? He has a bit of a flighty vibe. Well, it's not like he ever talks to me anyway.」
＃Protagonist
「I-is that so...」
