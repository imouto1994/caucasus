I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... feeling a bit nervous, I knock on the door.
＃Takamine
「Who is it? Oh, you. What's the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, could I talk to you for a moment?」
＃Takamine
「Well, I don't mind...」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes...」
＃Takamine
「So, what's your business?」
＃Protagonist
「Um...」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... feeling a bit nervous, I knock on the door.
＃Takamine
「...You again.」
＃Protagonist
「U-Um, could I talk to you for a moment?」
＃Takamine
「Fine, I suppose. Come in.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes...」
He's still scary...
＃Takamine
「What is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
＃Protagonist
「Um, Akane-san.」
＃Akane
「Yes?」
＃Protagonist
「Don't you find Takamine-san a bit... frightening?」
＃Akane
「Eh, really?」
Akane-san looks blankly at me.
＃Akane
「He isn't very friendly, but he's a good person, you know?」
＃Protagonist
「I know he's not a bad person, but still.」
Even so, he's still a bit scary.
＃Akane
「Well then, I'll ask Takamine-sama about Lady Ai.」
With that, Akane-san knocks on the door.
＃Takamine
「...What is it?」
Takamine-san peeks out.
＃Akane
「Takamine-sama, have you seen Lady Ai around?」
＃Takamine
「Ai-kun? ...No, I haven't.」
＃Akane
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「...Did something happen?」
＃Akane
「The thing is... she hasn't been seen for a while.」
＃Takamine
「Hmm...」
Takamine-san seems to be lost in thought for a moment.
＃Protagonist
「Um, please let us know if you see Ai-san.」
＃Takamine
「...Understood. I'll look for her as well.」
＃Akane
「Then, we'll be going. Please excuse us.」
＃Protagonist
「Now, let's head elsewhere.」
We decided to move on.
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room again.
＃Protagonist
「...Akane-san, if you would.」
＃Akane
「Yes, understood.」
Akane-san steps forward and knocks on the door.
＃Akane
「Oh... it seems he isn't in.」
We waited for a while, but there was no sign of Takamine-san coming out.
＃Protagonist
「I wonder if he's out searching for her.」
＃Akane
「I'm sure that's it. Well then, let's go too.」
Prompted by Akane-san, I headed for another location.
