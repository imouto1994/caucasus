"Shion-san won't receive any inheritance... Then why did Rokuyou-san try to marry her? It's not like they were particularly close..."
#Protagonist

#Maya
"...That is a matter concerning our family, and not something to be shared with guests."
#Protagonist
"Y-You're right, of course..."
#Ai
"...I don't know much about the distribution of the inheritance. However, Father held many copyrights for his compositions..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Benio
"Inheritance, huh... Putting aside Father's personal assets, the Nanatsuki family's assets consist of little more than this mansion and the family name. I have no need for them."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Protagonist
"Right, of course..."
#Tsujimura
"...Regarding that matter, there is nothing I can say."
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
#Takamine
"All I can tell you is that Shion-kun will not receive any inheritance whatsoever."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"That is... not an issue I can say anything about."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Akane
"I'm sorry... I don't really know."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I've heard the Master had quite an inheritance... Even a third of it would be a substantial amount."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
