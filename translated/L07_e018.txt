"...Why did this happen to Lady Benio too...?"
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."

#Satoshi
"True..."
#Takamine
"I'm told Lady Benio's exact cause of death hasn't been determined yet... I only hope it wasn't poisoning."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Mikanagi
"I don't know the direct cause of Benio-san's death. However, I believe her neck was severed either immediately after death or just before she expired."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
