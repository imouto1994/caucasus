I’ve made my way to Souko-san's room.
I give the door a light knock.
#Souko
"Oh, it's you. What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Do you have a second?"
#Souko
"Well, I don't mind."
With that, Souko-san invited me into the room.
#Souko
"So, what's your business?"
#Protagonist
"Well, you see..."
I’ve come to Souko-san's room.
I give the door a light knock.
#Souko
"Oh, you again. What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Do you have a moment to talk?"
#Souko
"Sure, that's fine."
With that, Souko-san invited me into the room.
#Souko
"What is it this time?"
#Protagonist
"Well, you see..."
I’ve made my way to Souko-san's room.
I give the door a light knock.
I wait for a while, but there was no response from within.
Is she not in?
I gave up and decided to go somewhere else.
