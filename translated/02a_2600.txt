「Mnh...」
I woke up.
That sound just now...
I turned my head and looked at Shion-san's bed.
She wasn't there.
Had she just left?
Maybe she went to use the bathroom...
Even so, it bothers me that she didn't say a single word to me.
Did she take care not to wake me, or...
＃Protagonist
「............」
I stood up.
If it's nothing, then fine.
If it is something... I have to make sure.
I went down the stairs and shivered at the cold.
...The door was open.
Did she go outside...?
＃Protagonist
「Ngh...」
I woke up with the feeling that my body had been shaken.
I wonder what that was...
I looked around.
The door was open.
＃Protagonist
「Eh...」
I looked up the stairs.
Nobody was there.
Did Shion-san go outside...?
I looked out from the doorway.
Through the blizzard, in front of the office door, Shion-san was standing still.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san!?」
Without even answering my call, she went into the manor.
＃Protagonist
「Wait, Shion-san!」
I entered the office and called out to her again.
Shion-san turned around in silence.
A hollow gaze that I couldn't tell where she was looking.
＃Protagonist
「What's the matter... Shion-san?」
＃Shion
「...Eh?」
Even though I’d been right there, she looked at me with an expression as if she’d been caught off guard.
＃Shion
「Ah...」
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san!?」
I hurried to catch Shion-san as she collapsed from her knees.
She seemed to have lost consciousness.
No... it felt more like she was simply asleep rather than having lost consciousness.
I hesitated over whether to go call Dr. Mikanagi, but I picked Shion-san up.
She was startlingly light.
I'll take her back to her room.
She's probably fine.
She was surely just sleepwalking.
I easily carried her to the second floor of the tower and laid her on the bed.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...」
＃Shion
「............」
...Is she alright?
I adjusted the covers for her, wrapped myself in a blanket in the corner of the room, and crouched down.
I'll try to stay awake as much as possible.
So I can respond immediately if anything happens to Shion-san.
