I made it back to the room I had been assigned.
The time was 10:30 PM.
I should probably stay in my room and wait for a while.
There was a knock at the door.
＃Protagonist
"Come in."
＃Narumi
"Excuse me."
It was Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
"You probably heard this from Benio-ojousama already, but please stay in this room until midnight."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, I know."
＃Narumi
"I'm not gonna say 'don't you dare step a foot outside,' but it's not like you've got anything else to do anyway."
＃Protagonist
"Well, you're not wrong."
＃Narumi
"So just stay put for a bit. I'll come and get you when it's time."
Narumi-san emphasized the point before leaving the room.
Stay put, huh...
Well, since there really wasn't anything to do, I might as well try to get some sleep.
It was still snowing outside.
The tower was barely visible through the swirling snow.
I wondered if Shion-san was getting ready for the ceremony too.
I flopped down onto the bed.
Narumi-san was supposed to come get me around midnight, so I'd just sleep until then.
＃Souko
"Oh, were you sleeping?"
Souko-san's sudden voice made me open my eyes just as I was drifting off.
＃Protagonist
"...I was just about to."
＃Souko
"Good. It would've been a pain if I had to wake you up again."
Souko-san sat down on the edge of the bed.
＃Souko
"So, did you find anything out?"
＃Protagonist
"I got the details of the 'Curse of the Seven' from Benio-san."
＃Souko
"Oh, look at you. Care to share?"
＃Protagonist
"Alright, one by one. 'First, all heads of the Nanatsuki family have died mysterious deaths.'"
＃Souko
"They said Kousei-shi committed suicide. Does that mean every single head of the family has killed themselves?"
＃Protagonist
"Who knows... she didn't tell me that much. Next, 'Second, no males are ever born into the Nanatsuki family.'"
＃Souko
"No males... so that means every husband is married into the family. If that's the case, then the one carrying the Nanatsuki bloodline isn't Kousei-shi, but Maya-san..."
＃Protagonist
"Since Tsujimura-san is Kousei-san's younger brother, that seems very likely."
＃Souko
"And all the children are female too. What's next?"
＃Protagonist
" 'Third, the cases of spirited-away victims in Nanatsuki Village.'"
＃Souko
"Spirited away... I wonder if that's connected to the family too?"
＃Protagonist
"I don't know. She didn't tell me anything else about it."
＃Souko
"...Next?"
＃Protagonist
" 'Fourth, the mansion is painted entirely in pitch black.'"
＃Souko
"Well, that much is obvious. I'm sure there's some reason for it, though..."
＃Protagonist
" 'Fifth, a massive swarm of crows covers the mansion.'"
＃Souko
"Crows, huh... There's no way to confirm that in this blizzard."
＃Protagonist
" 'Sixth, the matter of the "Sacrifice of the Seven".'"
＃Souko
"If we take it literally, it means a human sacrifice... It sounds like it's closely related to the spirit-away cases. And the last one?"
＃Protagonist
" 'Seventh, the ghost of the sacrificed girl wanders the halls of the mansion.' ...That's all of them."
＃Souko
"...It suddenly got very suspicious at the end there."
Souko-san muttered with a look of exasperation.
＃Protagonist
"Well, these kinds of 'Seven Mysteries' are always a bit far-fetched, aren't they?"
＃Souko
"True. Now we just need to dig deeper into these... though we can't exactly go around asking about it openly."
＃Protagonist
"I think Benio-san might be willing to cooperate."
＃Souko
"If she were really going to cooperate, wouldn't she have given you more details?"
＃Protagonist
"Well... maybe you're right."
＃Souko
"Keep investigating. But be subtle about it."
＃Protagonist
"What about you, Souko-san?"
＃Souko
"I've been looking into things myself, you know. Not that I've found a damn thing."
＃Protagonist
"No, nothing yet. How about you?"
＃Souko
"I've been doing plenty of research. Not that I've found a damn thing."
＃Protagonist
"...Are you sure you aren't just in your room drinking cola?"
＃Souko
"Of course not! I have a limited supply, so they'd be gone in no time."
＃Protagonist
"But you brought so many with you. Those full bottles were heavy, you know."
＃Souko
"I just heard the weather forecast on my portable radio. Apparently, this blizzard is going to last for quite a while longer."
＃Protagonist
"Wait... really?"
＃Souko
"Seems like a cold air mass is stalled right over us. We might be stuck here for a few days."
＃Protagonist
"A few days... huh."
That's not good...
It's not like I have to get back to Tokyo urgently, but we can't just keep imposing on them for days on end.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san, what should we do?"
＃Souko
"Hmm... I'll have to ration my cola. But it's not very good once it goes flat..."
＃Protagonist
"That's not what I'm talking about!"
＃Souko
"Well, there's no other reason to hurry. Let's just take it easy."
With that, Souko-san flopped down onto the bed.
＃Protagonist
"If you want to take it easy, go do it in your own room."
＃Souko
"What's the harm?"
＃Protagonist
"There's plenty of harm."
I replied instantly.
＃Souko
"You're such a spoilsport."
Souko-san gave up and got off the bed.
＃Souko
"Fine, fine. See you later, then."
With a big yawn, Souko-san left the room.
Sigh, good grief.
I wish Souko-san would realize that she shouldn't be lounging around in a room belonging to a guy her age.
＃Protagonist
"...Time to sleep."
