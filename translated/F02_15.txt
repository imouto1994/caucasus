I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
＃Takamine
「Oh, it's you... morning.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning. Um, do you have a moment to talk?」
＃Takamine
「I don't mind... but make it quick.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-yes...」
He really is intimidating...
＃Takamine
「So, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Well...」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
＃Takamine
「...You again.」
＃Protagonist
「A-ah, um, do you have a moment to talk?」
＃Takamine
「Fine. Come in.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-yes...」
He really is intimidating...
＃Takamine
「What is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
＃Protagonist
「Huh... I guess he's not here.」
There was no response no matter how long I waited.
Nothing for it; let's try somewhere else.
