"It's a story that comes up right away if you look into Nanatsuki Village. Though I haven't found any documents that go into the finer details."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Maya
"...I'm aware that such rumors are circulating in the village. However, I'm not familiar with the specifics."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
＃Ai
"...I do not wish to answer that."
＃Protagonist
"I see... I'm sorry."
＃Benio
"The curses are seven in number, just as the name suggests. First—'The matter of the heads of the Nanatsuki family all meeting unnatural deaths.'"
＃Benio
"'Second, the matter of no males being born into the Nanatsuki family.' 'Third, the spirited-away incidents in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Fourth, the matter of the manor being coated in pitch-black.'"
＃Benio
"'Fifth, the matter of a swarm of crows covering the manor.' 'Sixth, the matter of the "Sacrifice of the Seven-Possessed".' 'Seventh, the matter of the spirit of the sacrificed girl wandering the manor.' ...That is all."
＃Benio
"If you wish to investigate, please, do as you like. Though my efforts may be modest, I would be happy to assist you."
＃Protagonist
"Ah... thank you very much."
＃Tsujimura
"I... don't know much about such things..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Rokuyou
"The curse...? Come to think of it, I feel like Benio mentioned something like that. You should try asking her."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Takamine
"I have no interest in such trivial nonsense."
＃Protagonist
"I-I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"The curse? ...Ah, that's just a rumor, right? I think Benio-san would be the one familiar with those stories."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"T-The curse... I know there are all sorts of things being said... it's quite scary, isn't it?"
＃Protagonist
"It is..."
＃Narumi
"The curse? I've certainly heard people in town talking about it... but if you want details, why not ask Lady Benio?"
＃Protagonist
"That's a good idea."
