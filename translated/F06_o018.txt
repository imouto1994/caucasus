＃Souko
「There's no way I'd know if you ask me. You have to ask the people of this house.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「...I suppose something like that did happen... I don't remember it well, it was so long ago...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Ai
「...I believe it was shortly after I was born... I expect Tsujimura-san would know.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Benio
「The cause of Takamine's injury? Ask him or Tsujimura.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Shion
「Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「I thought so...」
＃Tsujimura
「So Takamine-sama told you... That was nearly twenty years ago. A fire broke out at a mountain cabin nearby...」
＃Protagonist
「Nearby... but that's across the suspension bridge, isn't it?」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, that's right. A mother and daughter were living in that cabin, but despite Takamine-sama's efforts, the mother passed away...」
＃Protagonist
「...Did the children survive?」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes. There were two daughters; they were rescued despite suffering burns.」
＃Protagonist
「Two... sisters, then.」
＃Tsujimura
「One was severely injured and couldn't be treated here, so she was left in the care of a doctor in town... but we decided to raise the other one here.」
＃Protagonist
「...Wait, that remaining child... was she albino?」
＃Tsujimura
「...She was an ordinary child at first. But she gradually turned white... perhaps she wasn't getting enough nutrition...」
＃Protagonist
「...That was Shion-san, wasn't it?」
＃Tsujimura
「That is correct... Um, could I ask you to please keep this matter strictly confidential...?」
＃Protagonist
「...Understood.」
＃Takamine
「...I have nothing more to say about it.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「I heard about the fire from my father. Apparently, the rescued child's burns were so severe she was taken to a hospital in town, but then she suddenly disappeared.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「I'm sorry... I don't really know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「I'm not quite sure about that.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
