IÅfve arrived at the central hall on the first floor.
Nobody is here.
Just as I was about to head elsewhere, a vase tucked in the corner caught my eye.
Some white flowers have been arranged in it.
They hang their heads as if bowing, and the inner petals have green markings.
I wonder if these are snowdrops.
Even if I wanted to ask someone, there's nobody here.
What should I do...
IÅfve come to the first-floor hall.
Nobody seems to be around.
What should I do...
