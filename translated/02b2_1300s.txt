There's a small window for letting in light.
It doesn't seem to be locked, but it's so small that it'd be impossible for a person to pass through.
There's no chance the culprit came in or out through here.
#Satoshi
"...The blood must have sprayed when the neck was cut."
#Souko
"But... the head is missing again."
#Satoshi
"Did they take it with them...?"
#Souko
"I don't understand the reason. Unless this body belongs to someone other than Ai-san."
#Mikanagi
"...I'm certain it's Ai-san. I've examined her before, so I wouldn't mistake her."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...They likely decapitated her here.
Dr. Mikanagi placed his hands together in prayer before Ai-san's body and began the autopsy.
#Mikanagi
"...It hasn't been very long since the neck was severed. However... I can see some slight livor mortis. Did someone move the body?"
#Satoshi
"No... it's just as we found it."
#Mikanagi
"The livor mortis is appearing toward the legs. Normally, it occurs as congestion in the parts of the body that are underneath, but it's not appearing on the arms... which are currently the lower part."
#Souko
"The culprit moved the body...?"
#Mikanagi
"...They likely killed her using some other method first, then moved the body and severed the neck."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...The beheaded body of Ai-san lies there.
The gears that move the clock.
Their movement has been stopped now.
The gears aren't moving.
#Satoshi
"...A snowdrop."
A single white flower had fallen to the floor.
#Satoshi
"Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san...?"
#Souko
"Likely so..."
#Satoshi
"This flower is...?"
A single white flower had fallen to the floor.
Why would it be in a place like this...
#Souko
"It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall... I wonder if the fact that only the flower head has fallen is a metaphor for the headless body..."
#Satoshi
"...That's a gruesome thought."
The snowdrop flower has fallen.
A small piece of trash, like a scrap of paper, is lying on the floor.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but...
No matter how many times I look at it, it just looks like trash.
#Satoshi
"An axe again...?"
#Mikanagi
"...They likely used that to sever the neck. The cut surface is just like the one on Isamu."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
...It seems the same thing that happened to Rokuyou-san has occurred.
