"I wonder if there's a connection between Shion-san being targeted and you two being locked in the basement..."
＃Protagonist
"I wonder..."
＃Souko
"...There's a good chance Shion-san will be targeted by the killer. We have to make sure she's careful..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Maya
"To think even Shion was targeted..."
＃Protagonist
"Her life isn't in danger, so please don't worry."
＃Maya
"Shion is still safe, isn't she...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes... there's no need to worry."
＃Ai
"Why even Shion... Why...!"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know that yet."
＃Ai
"I'm glad it was me who was targeted... if it had been Shion..."
＃Protagonist
"Ai-san..."
＃Benio
"...I understand there's a possibility Shion will be targeted. However... something feels off about it..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"Shion, huh... She likely feels a sense of debt since she was adopted. That's why she never voices any complaints about her circumstances..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"I'm... all right now. I'm sorry to have worried you."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"I... don't really understand what is happening... I am sorry..."
＃Protagonist
"No..."
＃Tsujimura
"So even Lady Shion is not safe after all..."
＃Protagonist
"It seems so..."
＃Tsujimura
"...Lady Shion seems to be quite depressed..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"...Shion-kun is safe, I assume?"
＃Protagonist
"Y-Yeah..."
＃Takamine
"There's a possibility that danger could close in on Shion-kun as well. Keep an eye on her."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Mikanagi
"Shion-san's condition has mostly recovered. It seems the poison was a very small dose, and she threw it up immediately."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"If you're looking for Shion-san, she's likely in her room or the office."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Akane
"So even Lady Shion is being targeted... What on earth is the killer's objective...?"
＃Protagonist
"Good question..."
＃Akane
"Lady Shion? I believe she is likely in her room..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"I don't think you need to worry about Lady Shion's condition... but who could have done it..."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
＃Narumi
"If it's Lady Shion, she's probably in her room or the office, right?"
＃Protagonist
"I see."
