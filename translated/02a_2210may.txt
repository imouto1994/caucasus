I arrived in front of Maya-san's room at the far end of the west side of the second floor.
#Satoshi
"Maya-san, are you awake?"
The door opened, and Maya-san peeked her face out.
#Maya
"Oh... what brings you here at this hour?"
#Satoshi
"I thought I'd protect you here tonight, Maya-san."
#Maya
"Oh my..."
#Satoshi
"The one most likely to be targeted next is you, Maya-san. I want to prevent any further casualties somehow."
#Maya
"But... I can't let a guest do such a thing."
#Satoshi
"But I want to prevent any further victims from appearing."
#Maya
"Hehe... thank you. But there's no need for worry. Besides... I can't let a gentleman stay in my room."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right, of course..."
#Maya
"I'll make sure to lock the door and rest tonight. Thank you very much for your advice."
#Satoshi
"No... I'm the one who should apologize for saying such a strange thing."
#Maya
"Well then, good night."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
