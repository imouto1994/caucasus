I arrived in front of Maya-san's room at the far end of the west side of the second floor.
＃Protagonist
「Maya-san, are you awake?」
The door opened, and Maya-san peeked her face out.
＃Maya
「Oh... what brings you here at this hour?」
＃Protagonist
「I thought I'd protect you here tonight, Maya-san.」
＃Maya
「Oh my...」
＃Protagonist
「The one most likely to be targeted next is you, Maya-san. I want to prevent any further casualties somehow.」
＃Maya
「But... I can't let a guest do such a thing.」
＃Protagonist
「But I want to prevent any further victims from appearing.」
＃Maya
「Hehe... thank you. But there's no need for worry. Besides... I can't let a gentleman stay in my room.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-You're right, of course...」
＃Maya
「I'll make sure to lock the door and rest tonight. Thank you very much for your advice.」
＃Protagonist
「No... I'm the one who should apologize for saying such a strange thing.」
＃Maya
「Well then, good night.」
＃Protagonist
「...Phew.」
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
