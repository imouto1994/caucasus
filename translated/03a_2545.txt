We returned to Mr. Kousei's room.
I wonder if this key will actually work...
#Narumi
"I wonder what's going to come out..."
#Main Character
"Who knows..."
I inserted the key into the floor of the fireplace.
It turned.
The part of the floor that acted as a lid lifted slightly.
#Main Character
"...I'm opening it."
I swallowed hard and placed my hands on the lid.
#Main Character
"This is..."
A dark hole gaped open.
#Narumi
"A chimney... no, there's a ladder attached."
Iron rungs to step on were attached to the wall, continuing all the way down.
#Narumi
"I thought there'd be treasure right as we opened it..."
#Main Character
"What should we do...?"
#Narumi
"We can't exactly turn back now after coming this far, can we?"
#Main Character
"You're right... but wait, wasn't the chapel directly below this room?"
#Narumi
"...It's likely passing behind the altar. It probably leads to the basement."
#Main Character
"True, that's really the only place it could go..."
I wonder what on earth is down there...
#Main Character
"Let's head down."
#Narumi
"...Right."
Carrying a flashlight, I climbed into the hole.
It's quite narrow... I didn't even have room to shine the light downward.
#Narumi
"Don't look up."
#Main Character
"It's pitch black; I can't see anything anyway,"
I said to Narumi-san as she followed me down.
#Narumi
"It's a matter of principle."
#Main Character
"...More importantly, we won't get trapped down here, will we?"
#Narumi
"Stop saying things like that."
#Main Character
"But the culprit is still out there. If they find out we're in a place like this..."
#Narumi
"I locked the door to the room above from the inside, so it'll be fine. Probably."
#Main Character
"I'm counting on that... Oh, I think I've reached the bottom."
My feet touched the floor.
#Main Character
"This is..."
At first glance, it looked like an ordinary room.
However, it had a different atmosphere from the other rooms in this mansion.
No windows—which was to be expected.
There were no unnecessary decorations on the walls, leaving the brick exposed.
There was only a desk, a chair, and several shelves.
#Narumi
"To think a room like this existed..."
Narumi-san whispered.
#Main Character
"This is..."
An elaborately bound notebook was sitting on the desk.
#Main Character
"It looks like a diary or something..."
#Narumi
"What's written in it?"
Narumi-san peered over.
#Main Character
"Wait a second... it's too dark to read it here."
#Narumi
"Shall we read it after we get back upstairs?"
#Main Character
"What could Kousei-san have wanted to tell us...?"
#Narumi
"We'll find out once we look into it."
