We returned to Mr. Kousei's room.
I wonder if this key will actually work...
＃Narumi
「I wonder what's going to come out...」
＃Protagonist
「Who knows...」
I inserted the key into the floor of the fireplace.
It turned.
The part of the floor that acted as a lid lifted slightly.
＃Protagonist
「...I'm opening it.」
I swallowed hard and placed my hands on the lid.
＃Protagonist
「This is...」
A dark hole gaped open.
＃Narumi
「A chimney... no, there's a ladder attached.」
Iron rungs to step on were attached to the wall, continuing all the way down.
＃Narumi
「I thought there'd be treasure right as we opened it...」
＃Protagonist
「What should we do...?」
＃Narumi
「We can't exactly turn back now after coming this far, can we?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right... but wait, wasn't the chapel directly below this room?」
＃Narumi
「...It's likely passing behind the altar. It probably leads to the basement.」
＃Protagonist
「True, that's really the only place it could go...」
I wonder what on earth is down there...
＃Protagonist
「Let's head down.」
＃Narumi
「...Right.」
Carrying a flashlight, I climbed into the hole.
It's quite narrow... I didn't even have room to shine the light downward.
＃Narumi
「Don't look up.」
＃Protagonist
「It's pitch black; I can't see anything anyway,」
I said to Narumi-san as she followed me down.
＃Narumi
「It's a matter of principle.」
＃Protagonist
「...More importantly, we won't get trapped down here, will we?」
＃Narumi
「Stop saying things like that.」
＃Protagonist
「But the culprit is still out there. If they find out we're in a place like this...」
＃Narumi
「I locked the door to the room above from the inside, so it'll be fine. Probably.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm counting on that... Oh, I think I've reached the bottom.」
My feet touched the floor.
＃Protagonist
「This is...」
At first glance, it looked like an ordinary room.
However, it had a different atmosphere from the other rooms in this mansion.
No windows?which was to be expected.
There were no unnecessary decorations on the walls, leaving the brick exposed.
There was only a desk, a chair, and several shelves.
＃Narumi
「To think a room like this existed...」
Narumi-san whispered.
＃Protagonist
「This is...」
An elaborately bound notebook was sitting on the desk.
＃Protagonist
「It looks like a diary or something...」
＃Narumi
「What's written in it?」
Narumi-san peered over.
＃Protagonist
「Wait a second... it's too dark to read it here.」
＃Narumi
「Shall we read it after we get back upstairs?」
＃Protagonist
「What could Kousei-san have wanted to tell us...?」
＃Narumi
「We'll find out once we look into it.」
