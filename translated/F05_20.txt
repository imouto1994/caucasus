I’ve reached the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
＃Ai
「Oh... is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello. Do you have a moment?」
＃Ai
「Yes, of course. Come in.」
With that, Ai-san guided me into the room.
＃Ai
「So, what is it you need?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve reached the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
＃Ai
「Oh... was there something else?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello. Do you have a moment?」
＃Ai
「Yes, go ahead.」
With that, Ai-san guided me into the room.
＃Ai
「What's on your mind?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve come to Ai-san's room.
Ai-san's remains are laid to rest here...
I pulled my hand back from the doorknob and decided to head elsewhere.
