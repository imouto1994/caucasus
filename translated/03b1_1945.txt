Once I cut the search short and returned to the hall, Tsujimura-san and Takamine-san were there.
＃Takamine
「Did you find her?」
Noticing me, Takamine-san called out.
＃Protagonist
「No... I looked around most places, but...」
＃Tsujimura
「I checked the rooms that were kept locked, but she was nowhere to be found.」
＃Takamine
「Honestly... it's because you people keep provoking the culprit.」
＃Protagonist
「That's...」
＃Tsujimura
「This is no time for such talk.」
Tsujimura-san interjected.
＃Tsujimura
「Where on earth could she have gone...?」
＃Narumi
「Ah... Tsujimura-san!」
Narumi-san rushed into the hall from the eastern corridor.
＃Tsujimura
「Has something happened...?」
＃Narumi
「The kitchen smells like something's burning! Something... might still be on fire...」
＃Protagonist
「What...!?」
The kitchen had been left as it was since the explosion at noon.
It was unlikely that something would start burning now, but...
＃Protagonist
「...I'm going to take a look.」
What could it be?
I had a tremendously bad premonition.
