「It seems this has been Nanatsuki family territory for a very long time. Since it was isolated from other villages, a unique culture might have developed here.」

「Is that so...」

「It is said that our ancestors reclaimed the land in this area. Ever since then, it seems this region has come to be called 'Nanatsuki'.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
