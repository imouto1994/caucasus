「That bell that rang in the middle of the night. I wonder if we'll hear it at noon today too.」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe so.」
＃Maya
「There has been a clock attached to this mansion since before it was relocated. As a remnant of that time, we still have the bell ring.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so?」
＃Ai
「The clock is visible from outside the mansion, but being in such a remote place, no one ever sees it.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「Does the sound of the bell bother you that much? The machine room is in the attic.」
＃Protagonist
「Oh... I see.」
＃Tsujimura
「The bell is rung from the machine room above the main entrance. It’s synchronized with the clock facing the outside.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「It certainly rang last night... but it isn't something worth being concerned about.」
＃Protagonist
「I guess so...」
＃Mikanagi
「The bell, eh...? I don't think you’d notice it much while inside your room.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Akane
「It rings at noon, so it’s quite convenient for keeping track of the time.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so?」
＃Narumi
「A bell? Did one ring...? I don't really remember.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
