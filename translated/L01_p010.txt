「Narumi-san, huh... She's a bit of an enigma, but there's no real evidence to name her the killer.」
＃Protagonist
「...True.」
＃Maya
「I don't believe there was any point of contact between Narumi and Isamu-san...」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Ai
「Narumi-san occasionally does the night rounds. Although it was Tsujimura-san's turn yesterday...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「I doubt there was any sort of relationship between Narumi and Rokuyou, but I can't definitively say she's not the killer either.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「Narumi-san... I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「Mistress Minakami, Mistress Hiyama, and I take turns doing rounds after lights out, but I was the one on duty yesterday.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「I've never seen Rokuyou-kun and Minakami-kun exchange a word. Aside from official business, of course...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「Narumi-san is usually in the kitchen. She likely hardly spoke to Isamu at all.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「Last night I returned to our room with Narumi-san, though...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「After the ceremony, I went back to the room with Akane. It was late, so I just went right to sleep.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
