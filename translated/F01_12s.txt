It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
The wind and snow seem to be getting stronger than they were this evening.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.

「Hm...?」
A scrap of paper with something written on it is stuck to the toilet lid.
What could it be...
『The Tale of a Certain Man - Chapter 3』
That day's performance ended, and as I was catching my breath in the dressing room, that man from the food stall arrived with a massive amount of takoyaki.
"A thanks for lettin' me do business," the man replied bluntly.
However, that clearly excessive amount of takoyaki had already lost its heat, showing whether I liked it or not that they were leftovers.
I tried to refuse, but the man insisted there was no need for modesty and wouldn't listen.
To be honest, I didn't want them.
We continued that back-and-forth for a while, but finally worn down, I ended up accepting that forbidden thing.

「...What the hell is this?」
A scrap of paper titled "The Tale of a Certain Man - Chapter 3" is lying there.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are stored.
It contains rags, buckets, and so on.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It's just an ordinary mirror.
Of course, it's very clean and not cloudy at all.
A mirror is hanging on the wall.
When I turned the tap, cold water came out.
As expected, it might be a bit tough in this season.
The water has become very cold.
