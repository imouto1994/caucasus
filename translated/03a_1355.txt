When I reached the hall, I ran into Benio-san coming from the corridor on the opposite side.
#Protagonist
"Oh, Benio-san."
#Benio
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Nothing, I just thought I should check to make sure everyone is safe..."
#Benio
"...Did something happen?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah, well..."
I briefly explained that I’d been locked in the basement.
#Benio
"Hmm... that is certainly a problem. It wouldn't be surprising if someone was up to something..."
#Protagonist
"Was Tsujimura-san around?"
#Benio
"Yes, he was in the office. Shion is likely in her room as well."
#Protagonist
"I see. Then I'll go upstairs and check on Maya-san and the others."
#Benio
"I'll go too."
Benio-san and I climbed the stairs together.
We reached Maya-san's room at the very end of the corridor.
I knocked on the door.
#Protagonist
"Maya-san, are you there?"
The door opened, and a tired-looking Maya-san peered out.
#Maya
"Is something the matter?"
#Protagonist
"Has anything unusual happened?"
#Maya
"No, nothing in particular..."
#Benio
"Mother, please stay in your room for a while."
#Maya
"Very well..."
Though she looked suspicious, Maya-san returned to her room and closed the door.
#Benio
"I don't want her hearing anything unnecessary."
#Protagonist
"Right."
Next was... Ai-san.
I reached Ai-san's room and knocked.
#Protagonist
"Ai-san, are you there?"
#Ai
"Yes... what is it?"
Ai-san peered out.
#Benio
"Sister, has anything unusual happened?"
#Ai
"Unusual... no, nothing?"
#Protagonist
"I see. That's good."
#Ai
"Did something happen?"
Ai-san tilted her head.
#Protagonist
"No, it's nothing major."
I decided to keep the details hidden from Ai-san as well.
#Ai
"I see..."
#Benio
"We still don't know what might happen, so please stay alert, Sister."
#Ai
"Yes, I understand."
Ai-san went back into her room.
Souko-san approached from the other end of the corridor.
#Souko
"How is it here?"
#Protagonist
"No problems here."
#Souko
"Takamine-san was in his room too. Dr. Mikanagi... Akane-san went to check on him."
#Benio
"It seems we can assume nothing has happened yet."
#Souko
"Right... though we can't let our guard down."
#Protagonist
"Yeah... so Benio-san, please wait in your room too."
#Benio
"Hmm... that would probably be best."
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, could you stay in your room as well? I'll call you when the food is ready."
#Souko
"Sure, I understand. What about you?"
#Protagonist
"I'm going back to the dining room. I need to talk to Akane-san too."
#Benio
"I see. Bring some food by later, then."
#Protagonist
"Understood."
