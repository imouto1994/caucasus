When I open the dresser, I find a maid uniform inside.
Predictably, Akane-san isn't here.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
When I open the drawer, I find colorful underwear inside.

"Whoa...!"
I hurriedly closed the drawer.
Ransacking a woman's room isn't a good idea...

"Whoa...!"
I hurriedly closed the drawer.
Ransacking a woman's room isn't a good idea...
There are accessories inside the drawer.
Naturally, I can't find any clues about Akane-san's whereabouts.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
It looks like her private clothes, such as blouses and shirts, are in here.
I don't see anything particularly suspicious.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
I gently open the door leading to the bathroom, but nobody's inside.
I wonder where she's disappeared to...
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
This drawer seems to contain various small items.
Nothing seems particularly out of place.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?

"This is..."
It looks like a scrapbook filled with old newspaper clippings.

"Spirited away...?"
It seems to be articles dealing with the disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.
There's quite a lot of it.
From over twenty years ago until just recently.
All those who went missing are young women.
There have been legends of being "spirited away" in the Tono region of Iwate since long ago, but... all of these are recent—they've all happened during the Showa era.
This is a bit concerning...
Is this what the "Sacrifice of the Seven Possessed" is...?
But... the "Curse of the Seven Possessed" mentioned disappearances in a separate section.
If that's the case, is the "Sacrifice of the Seven Possessed" a different story...?
I'd like to confirm it with someone, but... if disappearances have been happening until recently and it's something related to the Nanatsuki family—

"...There's a chance those involved are still alive."
Those who are alive and would be of an age to be involved are—Maya-san.
If Kousei-san was one of those involved, then Tsujimura-san might be too.
I can't just go around asking questions carelessly...
It's a scrapbook of newspaper articles.
The bed is neatly made.
I can't tell when Akane-san disappeared from this alone.
When did Akane-san disappear...?
Several books are lined up.
Naturally, I can't find any clues as to Akane-san's whereabouts.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
Small items like wristwatches and rings are in here.
Naturally, I can't find any clues as to Akane-san's whereabouts.
Akane-san... where could she have gone?
I pick up the photo frame.
#Protagonist
"This is..."
It's a photo of a woman.
Could it be Akane-san's older sister—
It's the same as the photo Mikanagi-sensei had—
Given the handkerchief Akane-san had, maybe I should try talking to Mikanagi-sensei...
Akane-san's older sister, Akari Misono-san, huh...
A photo is displayed.
