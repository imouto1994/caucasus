＃Souko
"...Tsujimura-san manages the spare keys, and he's the person most capable of committing the crime... but even so, it's not right to suspect him without reason."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Maya
"I leave almost everything concerning the mansion to Tsujimura. He should have been doing rounds and such last night."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Ai
"Tsujimura-san works until late at night. There was a wedding yesterday, so I suppose it couldn't be helped..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"Tsujimura does manage the spare keys, that's certain... but it's also certain he has no reason to kill Rokuyou. Especially when he would be the most suspected."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Shion
"Seiji-san... he gave his blessings for the marriage between Master Rokuyou and me..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Last night, I worked in the office for a while after the ceremony. After that, I did rounds of the house. I did not encounter anyone besides you."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Tsujimura-san must have been working. If he was in his room, he surely would have noticed what was happening next door."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Mikanagi
"Tsujimura-san doing rounds of the mansion is a regular thing. Occasionally Akane-san or Narumi-san will do it, though."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Akane
"The night rounds are just to check if any doors were left unlocked... though in the middle of the mountains like this, it doesn't seem to mean much."
＃Protagonist
"Maybe so..."
＃Narumi
"The second floor is one thing, but the first floor corridor is completely divided, so rounds are a pain."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
