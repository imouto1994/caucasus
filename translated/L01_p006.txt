"...Tsujimura-san manages the spare keys, and he's the person most capable of committing the crime... but even so, it's not right to suspect him without reason."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"I leave almost everything concerning the mansion to Tsujimura. He should have been doing rounds and such last night."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"Tsujimura-san works until late at night. There was a wedding yesterday, so I suppose it couldn't be helped..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"Tsujimura does manage the spare keys, that's certain... but it's also certain he has no reason to kill Rokuyou. Especially when he would be the most suspected."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"Seiji-san... he gave his blessings for the marriage between Master Rokuyou and me..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Last night, I worked in the office for a while after the ceremony. After that, I did rounds of the house. I did not encounter anyone besides you."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Tsujimura-san must have been working. If he was in his room, he surely would have noticed what was happening next door."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Mikanagi
"Tsujimura-san doing rounds of the mansion is a regular thing. Occasionally Akane-san or Narumi-san will do it, though."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"The night rounds are just to check if any doors were left unlocked... though in the middle of the mountains like this, it doesn't seem to mean much."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
#Narumi
"The second floor is one thing, but the first floor corridor is completely divided, so rounds are a pain."
#Satoshi
"I see."
