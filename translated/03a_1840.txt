When I stepped out of the clinic, Dr. Mikanagi was standing nearby, leaning against the wall.
＃Mikanagi
「Hey there.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Dr. Mikanagi...」
＃Mikanagi
「This little one wouldn't let me in.」
The black cat was twining around the doctor's feet.
＃Protagonist
「Love...?」
＃Mikanagi
「It’s like a knight protecting Benio-san.」
＃Protagonist
「Hahaha...」
The black cat let out a proud meow.
＃Mikanagi
「I don't think we need to worry about Benio-san anymore... but the problem is who attacked her.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... someone from the foot of the mountain should be coming tomorrow, but I don't think we’ll make it through without something else happening.」
＃Mikanagi
「True. Once the police arrive, I’m sure many things will come to light. There’s a lot of uncertainty in my examinations, after all.」
＃Protagonist
「...Whatever the culprit's goal is, I think tonight is the climax.」
＃Mikanagi
「...I agree. I’d like everyone to stay in their rooms if possible, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Narumi
「Wait! It’s terrible!」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Narumi-san?」
Narumi-san came running from the atrium.
＃Mikanagi
「Is something wrong?」
＃Narumi
「Everything’s wrong... Kirihara-san’s room is...!」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Souko-san...? What happened!?」
＃Narumi
「Just come with me!」
Narumi-san grabbed my arm and pulled me along.
Souko-san... what on earth happened...?
