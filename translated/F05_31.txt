"Hello, Dr. Mikanagi."
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, just in time."
#Protagonist
"Eh, what is it?"
#Mikanagi
"I seem to have left my medical bag in my room. Would you mind going to fetch it for me?"
#Protagonist
"Sure, I don't mind, but..."
#Mikanagi
"Here, this is the key to my room. I’m counting on you."
With that, Dr. Mikanagi turned his gaze back to the documents on his desk.
It doesn't look like I'll be able to talk to him now. I'll take care of what he asked and then come back.
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Did you bring the bag for me?"
#Protagonist
"Ah..."
I completely forgot.
#Mikanagi
"Could it be you didn't know which room was mine?"
#Protagonist
"No, it's not that..."
It’s right next to mine, after all.
#Protagonist
"I-I'll go get it right away."
I hurried out of the infirmary as if I were making an escape.
#Protagonist
"Here, this is it, right?"
I held out the bag I’d brought from Dr. Mikanagi's room.
#Mikanagi
"Thank you, you've been a great help."
Dr. Mikanagi took several documents out of the bag.
#Protagonist
"Um... do you have a moment?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, I don't mind."
Now, what should I do?
#Protagonist
"Excuse me."
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Oh, what is it this time?"
#Protagonist
"Do you have a moment?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, go ahead."
Now, what should I do?
