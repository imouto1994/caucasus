I’ve made my way to the grand hall.
...But it seems no one is here.
What should I do...?
I’ve made my way to the grand hall.
＃Shion
"Ah..."
Shion-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san... It’s dangerous to be here all by yourself..."
＃Shion
"I'm sorry..."
Shion-san looks down.
＃Protagonist
"Um, Shion-san. Do you have a moment?"
＃Shion
"Um... that is, I'm sorry, I..."
Shion-san stood up.
＃Shion
"...Please excuse me."
Shion-san bowed her head and hurried out of the room.
...It seems she dislikes me.
＃Protagonist
"...I guess it can't be helped."
With slumped shoulders, I left the grand hall behind.
＃Shion
"What is it...?"
I’ve made my way to the grand hall.
＃Shion
"Ah... is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Hello, Shion-san. Do you have a moment?"
＃Shion
"Um... that is, I'm sorry, I..."
Shion-san stood up.
＃Shion
"...Please excuse me."
Shion-san bowed her head and hurried out of the room.
...It seems she dislikes me.
＃Protagonist
"...I guess it can't be helped."
With slumped shoulders, I left the grand hall behind.
＃Shion
"Yes, what can I do for you?"
I’ve made my way to the grand hall.
＃Akane
"Lady Ai doesn't seem to be here either..."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
I wonder where on earth she could have gone.
＃Protagonist
"...Let's look somewhere else."
＃Akane
"Yes..."
I’ve made my way to the grand hall.
＃Shion
"Ah..."
Shion-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san... It’s dangerous for you to be here alone."
＃Akane
"He's right, milady. There's no telling what might happen."
＃Shion
"I'm sorry..."
Shion-san looks down.
＃Protagonist
"Have you seen Ai-san?"
＃Shion
"Sister Ai...?"
＃Akane
"Yes... she isn't in her room."
＃Shion
"I... don't know..."
Shion-san shakes her head.
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Let's try looking somewhere else."
We parted ways with Shion-san and decided to search another location.
Shion-san was in the grand hall.
＃Shion
"Ah..."
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san, it seems you haven't... seen Ai-san around, have you?"
＃Shion
"...I'm sorry."
＃Protagonist
"No, it's not something you need to apologize for, Shion-san."
＃Akane
"Let's look elsewhere."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
We parted ways with Shion-san and decided to search another location.
