I grabbed Souko-san's bags along with my own and stepped into the hallway.
#Akane
"Um... shall I help you with your luggage?"
#Souko
"It's fine, we can manage this much."
I wasn't sure why Souko-san was the one answering for us.
Well, I'd been the pack mule for our entire mountain trek anyway, so I guess it was fine.
#Akane
"Let's see... Kirihara-sama's room is in the east wing of the second floor. May I show her there first?"
#Souko
"Yes, please."
We climbed the stairs and headed to the east wing.
Akane-san opened the first door on the right.
#Akane
"This will be your room, Kirihara-sama. Please, make yourself at home."
#Souko
"Yes, thank you. See you later."
Souko-san took her bags from me and closed the door.
#Akane
"Please follow me this way next. Your room is in the north wing."
We reached the north wing, and Akane-san opened the door on the front left.
#Akane
"After you."
#Protagonist
"Excuse me."
Stepping inside, I found myself momentarily speechless.
I knew it would be spacious.
I knew it would look expensive.
But actually seeing it for myself, I realized just how easily a person can be left in a daze.
#Akane
"Please feel free to use anything in the room. The bath is here, and towels are provided here as well... is something wrong?"
#Protagonist
"Ah, no... I was just thinking that I've ended up in an incredible place."
#Akane
"Fufu... I felt the same way when I first started working here. Even now, I still get so nervous whenever I have to carry the dishes."
#Protagonist
"Y-yeah, I can imagine."
#Akane
"Dinner will be served at eight, so please come down to the grand dining hall on the first floor when it's time."
#Protagonist
"Understood."
#Akane
"Then, if you'll excuse me."
With a bow, Akane-san left the room.
#Protagonist
"Phew..."
I let out a long breath and looked up at the ceiling.
It was obscenely high.
In the apartment near campus where I lived, I could touch the ceiling without even standing on my tiptoes.
The bed was also ridiculously large.
My entire room back home could probably fit right on top of it.
#Protagonist
"I'm never going to be able to relax here..."
The sheets were so perfectly smooth and taut that I felt hesitant to even sit down and wrinkle them.
I almost considered just sitting in a corner and hugging my knees instead.
But that would probably just make me feel pathetic, so I decided against it.
Instead, I sat down in front of the fireplace.
The charcoal was glowing a bright, fiery red.
Every now and then, it would let out a sharp pop.
It was nice and warm, but I wondered what I was supposed to do with it when it was time to sleep.
I'd have to ask later.
I stood up and turned around.
#Protagonist
"Ah, right."
I pulled a notebook out of my bag.
There was hardly anything written in it yet, but it might come in handy, so I'd better keep it on me.
For now, I started jotting down notes about the people staying here at the Shichitsuki mansion.
#Protagonist
"There, that should do it."
I set my pencil down and caught a glimpse of the window.
I couldn't see anything outside.
I walked over to the glass and pressed my finger against it.
The blizzard was still raging.
My fingertip grew colder by the second.
#Protagonist
"Hm...?"
In the midst of the black-and-white landscape outside, I thought I saw something.
I pressed my forehead against the glass and squinted into the dark.
#Protagonist
"A light...?"
Something was flickering not too far away.
It was to the right of the window—the northwest direction.
The building was shaped like a cross, and the private wing where Benio-san and her family stayed was to the southwest of this room, so it was definitely strange to see a light in the opposite direction.
Was there something out there?
The wind died down for just a moment.
#Protagonist
"A tower...?"
A tall, slender building emerged faintly from the darkness.
Illuminated by the fallen snow, it gave off an indescribably eerie vibe.
Why would something like that be there?
And more importantly, why was there a light burning inside?
The words 'Curse of the Seven' flashed through my mind.
No... surely not.
The wind picked up again, and the swirling snow hid the view outside once more.
I moved away from the window and collapsed onto the bed.
It was soft and warm.
Without even worrying about the wrinkles I was making in the sheets, I closed my eyes.
#???
"...Hey, wake up. It's time... hurry..."
...I could hear a gentle voice.
Yeah, I must be dreaming.
I knew I had to get up soon, but the warmth of the blankets was just too comfortable.
My body was exhausted, and even moving my eyelids felt like a monumental effort.
#Protagonist
"Mmn... five more minutes..."
#???
"Wake up, you idiot!"
#Protagonist
"Ow! Hey, don't hit me in the head..."
#Souko
"It's your own fault for not waking up."
Souko-san was looming over me, looking very pleased with herself.
Her right pinky finger was wrapped in a bandage.
It looked like Mikanagi-sensei had treated it for her.
#Protagonist
"I can't help it, I'm tired."
I sat up and grumbled.
#Souko
"They told us dinner was at eight in the dining hall, didn't they?"
#Protagonist
"Still, I think there are better ways to wake someone up."
I rubbed the spot where she'd hit me.
#Souko
"And how was I supposed to wake you up?"
#Protagonist
"Well, like you were doing at first—waking me up gently."
#Souko
"Heeh... I see."
A wicked grin spread across Souko-san's face.
#Protagonist
"Wait, Sou... Souko-san?"
#Souko
"...If that's what you want... then I'll be happy to oblige... Da-r-ling?"
A chill ran down my spine.
#Souko
"Darling, it's time to wake up~. If you don't get up right now, I'm going to pounce on you~!"
#Protagonist
"Wait, Souko-san!? Why are you crawling into bed with me!?"
I frantically held the blankets down from the outside.
#Souko
"Oh come on~. You'd better get up fast, or else~!"
#Protagonist
"Okay, okay! I'm getting up! I'm up!"
I practically scrambled out of bed to get away from her.
#Protagonist
"See? I'm awake!"
#Souko
"What's with that? Are you really so unhappy about me pouncing on you?"
Souko-san puffed out her cheeks in a pout.
[I'm not unhappy]
[I am unhappy]
[Please calm down]
#Protagonist
"No, it's not that I'm unhappy, it's just... look, we don't have much time, do we?"
#Souko
"Well, I guess you're right."
She still looked a little dissatisfied.
#Souko
"Stop messing around and let's go. It's almost time."
Souko-san grabbed my arm and started dragging me toward the hall.
#Protagonist
"Honestly, I am unhappy."
...She punched me with everything she had.
#Souko
"Stop being an idiot and let's go. We're out of time."
Souko-san dragged me out of the room by my arm.
#Protagonist
"Please, calm down, Souko-san."
#Souko
"...When you try to change the subject like that, it makes me feel like the idiot."
#Protagonist
"It's time, right? Come on, let's go."
I took the hand of the still-pouting Souko-san and led her out of the room.
#Souko
"Oh, could you hold this for me?"
Once we were in the hallway, Souko-san handed me a bottle of cola.
#Protagonist
"Why are you bringing this with you?"
#Souko
"Because I'll want something to drink during dinner too."
#Protagonist
"...I don't think a sweet drink really goes with dinner, though."
#Souko
"That's not true at all. I'd even be fine with ochazuke—no, colazuke."
#Protagonist
"...That would be incredibly embarrassing, so please, whatever you do, don't."
...I'd better make sure I guard that cola with my life until after the meal.
