A few days after the case was solved, for some reason I was still at the Nanatsuki mansion.
Shion-san was already at the police station in the town below, and Souko-san had gone there to provide an explanation.
Because of that, there were almost no people left in the mansion.
#Akane
"Ah... are you leaving?"
Akane-san came down from the second floor.
#Main Character
"Yeah, I can't exactly impose on your hospitality for too long..."
#Akane
"Benio-ojousama and Lord Takamine have left as well, after all..."
Akane-san let out a deep sigh and sat on the stairs.
#Main Character
"……Um, Akane-san."
#Akane
"Yes, what is it?"
#Main Character
"What... what will happen to Shion-san now...?"
#Akane
"……I wonder."
After whispering that, Akane-san fell silent.
#Main Character
"……Shion-san had her reasons. She was forced to... but no matter the reason, killing someone is wrong."
I believe that is an absolute truth of this world.
#Main Character
"……If only she could have endured it somehow..."
I was well aware that those weren't words someone who was just an outsider like me should be saying.
……They weren't words I could say after I was the one who made Shion-san a criminal.
#Akane
"I suppose... but even if I'm not the one to say it, I think it would have been difficult."
#Main Character
"……I suppose so..."
Enduring is hard.
Even I, if I were placed in that position——
#Main Character
"……You were able to endure, Akane-san. Even after Akari-san disappeared..."
#Akane
"Because I am powerless. That's why... I think I was able to give up."
Akane-san smiled weakly.
I'm sure she hadn't truly given up.
But Akane-san wouldn't go so far as to violate absolute truths just to uncover the reality.
Because Akane-san is... so very kind.
#Main Character
"……What are you going to do now, Akane-san?"
#Akane
"Eh... what do you mean...?"
#Main Character
"You came here to find out about your sister, didn't you? Are you going to keep investigating——?"
#Akane
"I will stay here and wait for everyone's return."
Akane-san declared it with such strength.
#Akane
"This is where Shion-ojousama will return to. It's a place we must protect."
#Main Character
"……You're strong."
#Akane
"That's not true at all."
She laughed and shook her head.
#Akane
"Because I am——a ladies' maid of the Nanatsuki family."
