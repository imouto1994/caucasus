I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
Akane-san knocks on the door.
＃Maya
「Oh... Akane, is something the matter?」
Maya-san appeared.
＃Akane
「Madam, have you seen Lady Ai?」
＃Maya
「Ai...? No, I haven't seen her.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... Do you have any idea where she might be?」
＃Maya
「I’ve been in my room this whole time, so...」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san's room is right next door, isn't it? Did you hear any noises?」
＃Maya
「Well... the soundproofing is quite good, so I haven't heard anything.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... thank you very much.」
＃Maya
「I’m sorry I couldn't be of more help.」
＃Akane
「Not at all... please excuse us.」
Maya-san returned to her room.
＃Protagonist
「Let's head somewhere else.」
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
Akane-san knocks on the door.
Maya-san appeared.
＃Maya
「Oh... have you still not found Ai?」
＃Akane
「No...」
＃Protagonist
「Sorry to bother you. If you notice anything, could you let us know immediately?」
＃Maya
「Yes, of course.」
＃Akane
「Then, Madam, please excuse us.」
Maya-san returned to her room.
＃Protagonist
「Let's head somewhere else.」
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
Akane-san knocks on the door.
I wait for a while, but there was no response from inside.
＃Akane
「It seems she isn't in.」
＃Protagonist
「So it seems...」
We decided to head elsewhere.
