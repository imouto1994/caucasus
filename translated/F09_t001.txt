"Whether they targeted a person, a location, or had some other objective... it isn't clear yet."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Maya
"The kitchen... In that case, we won't be able to prepare meals, will we..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Ai
"...I'm relieved it only ended with minor injuries. But why on earth the kitchen...?"
#Satoshi
"...We don't know yet."
#Benio
"The kitchen, huh... Doesn't it seem too different from before if they were targeting people?"
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
#Shion
"The kitchen... what on earth happened...?"
#Satoshi
"...We don't know yet."
#Tsujimura
"...The kitchen uses gas, so it would be easy to cause an explosion, but..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Takamine
"Destruction of the kitchen and minor burns... I'm glad there were few casualties."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Takamine
"...I suffered a major burn myself, long ago."
#Satoshi
"That... scar on your face...?"
#Takamine
"...Yeah. There was a fire in a mountain hut near here a long time ago, and I got this then."
#Satoshi
"That happened...?"
#Mikanagi
"The injury itself isn't serious... but I wonder why she was targeted..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Akane
"I was very close to being seriously injured..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... I'm glad you're okay."
#Narumi
"That was close... a bit more and it would've been a major burn."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
