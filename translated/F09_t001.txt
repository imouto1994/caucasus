"Whether they targeted a person, a location, or had some other objective... it isn't clear yet."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Maya
"The kitchen... In that case, we won't be able to prepare meals, will we..."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Ai
"...I'm relieved it only ended with minor injuries. But why on earth the kitchen...?"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
＃Benio
"The kitchen, huh... Doesn't it seem too different from before if they were targeting people?"
＃Protagonist
"Maybe so..."
＃Shion
"The kitchen... what on earth happened...?"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
＃Tsujimura
"...The kitchen uses gas, so it would be easy to cause an explosion, but..."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Takamine
"Destruction of the kitchen and minor burns... I'm glad there were few casualties."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
＃Takamine
"...I suffered a major burn myself, long ago."
＃Protagonist
"That... scar on your face...?"
＃Takamine
"...Yeah. There was a fire in a mountain hut near here a long time ago, and I got this then."
＃Protagonist
"That happened...?"
＃Mikanagi
"The injury itself isn't serious... but I wonder why she was targeted..."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Akane
"I was very close to being seriously injured..."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... I'm glad you're okay."
＃Narumi
"That was close... a bit more and it would've been a major burn."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
