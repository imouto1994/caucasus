I've come to Maya-san's room, located at the far end of the west side on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Maya-san. Have you seen our Kirihara?」
＃Maya
「Mistress Kirihara? ...No, I haven't seen her. I've been in my room this whole time...」
＃Protagonist
「I see... Sorry for the intrusion.」
＃Maya
「Please come again.」
Maya-san saw me off, and I decided to head somewhere else.
I've come to Maya-san's room, at the far end of the west side on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... have you still not found Mistress Kirihara?」
＃Protagonist
「No...」
＃Maya
「That's worrying, isn't it...」
＃Protagonist
「Please let me know immediately if anything happens.」
＃Maya
「Yes, of course.」
I'll go somewhere else.
