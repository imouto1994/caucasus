I stepped out into the corridor and headed for Souko-san's room first.
It would be best to talk to Souko-san before anyone else.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, it's me."
The door opened and Souko-san appeared.
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"It seems Akane-san is missing... do you know anything?"
#Souko
"Akane-san...? Since when?"
#Protagonist
"I'm not sure, but at least I haven't seen her this morning."
#Souko
"I see... then it's possible she disappeared during the night..."
#Protagonist
"Um... Souko-san, do you think... the killer did something...?"
#Souko
"...I wonder. It hasn't been decided yet."
Souko-san shook her head.
#Souko
"Right now, finding her as soon as possible is the most important thing."
#Protagonist
"...Yeah, I know. Well, let me know if anything happens."
I told Souko-san that and decided to head elsewhere.
