With somber expressions, we returned to the hall.
Souko-san and Dr. Mikanagi were still there.
#Souko
"Where's Ai-san……?"
Souko-san rushed over.
But she stopped when she saw my face.
#Benio
"……Doctor, please examine my sister."
#Mikanagi
"Yes…… however……"
Dr. Mikanagi seemed to have sensed the strange atmosphere as well.
#Benio
"……I'm going to tell Mother and the others."
Without looking back, Benio-san left the hall.
#Souko
"……Let's go too. It's Ai-san's room, right?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes……"
……Unable to explain the state Ai-san was in, I simply followed behind Souko-san and the others as they headed up the stairs.
