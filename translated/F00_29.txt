The far end of the second floor's north side.
This is the room that belonged to the previous head of the house, Kousei-shi.
I give the doorknob a light turn, but naturally, it appears to be locked.
Even if I asked Tsujimura-san, he probably wouldn't lend me the key... there's nothing for it right now.

"...Narumi-san, if you would."
＃Narumi
"Hold on a second... there, it's open."
I step inside.
This is the first time I've ever set foot in here.
So this is... the room the late Kousei-san used...
＃Protagonist
"There's... a fireplace."
＃Narumi
"Yes... what do you want to do?"
I enter Kousei-san's room.
＃Narumi
"I don't think the key is in here, but... do you want to search just in case?"
