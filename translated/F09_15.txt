I've come to the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
#Takamine
"Is it you... What do you want?"
#Satoshi
"Um, can we talk for a bit?"
#Takamine
"...Fine. Come in."
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes..."
#Takamine
"So, what's your business?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
#Takamine
"...It's you again."
#Satoshi
"A-Ah, can we talk for a bit?"
#Takamine
"I suppose that's fine."
#Satoshi
"Y-Yes..."
#Takamine
"What is it this time?"
I've come to the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
#Satoshi
"Takamine-san, it's me."
However, no matter how long I wait, there's no response from inside.
Maybe he's not there.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
