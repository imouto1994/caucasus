"Let's avoid any rooms that are currently occupied."
＃Protagonist
"Good point."
We decided to head elsewhere.
This room is vacant.
I turn the doorknob, but it appears to be locked.
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san, if you would."
＃Narumi
"...It's just another guest room, so I don't think it'll matter... but here, it's open."
＃Protagonist
"Of course, there's a fireplace..."
＃Narumi
"Yes... though I doubt this is the place the code was referring to... Do you want to check it just in case?"
I’ve returned to this room.
＃Narumi
"Weren't we just here?"
＃Protagonist
"Well, yes..."
＃Narumi
"If you still want to investigate, then make it quick."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
This room is currently empty.
＃Narumi
"Want to see if we can find a key? I've no idea if we'll find anything searching blindly like this, though."
