There was a short piece of wood lying in the storage area.
＃Protagonist
「Couldn't we use this for something?」
＃Narumi
「Isn't it a bit short?」
＃Protagonist
「Can even your arms not reach, Narumi-san?」
＃Narumi
「I wonder... let me see it.」
Narumi-san took the piece of wood and reached her arm through the grate.
＃Narumi
「Nnh... nn-ugh... it’s no good. I can't move it unless I can hook it onto something.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
No choice, then. I'll look for something else.
It seems this stick alone won't be enough to move the bar.
A piece of rope about a meter long came out of a box.
I wonder if this could be used for something...
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, the thing blocking the door is a rod, right?」
＃Narumi
「That’s what it looked like to me.」
＃Protagonist
「Could we hook it with this rope?」
＃Narumi
「I wonder... let me see it.」
Narumi-san took the rope and put her arm through the grate.
＃Narumi
「Nnh... nope, it’s no good. It won't hook onto it.」
＃Protagonist
「I guess it’s not going to be like fishing...」
No choice, I'll look for something else.
I should look for other potentially useful items.
The large quantity of raw vegetables we gathered.
＃Protagonist
「...Could we use these for something?」
＃Narumi
「They’ll fill our stomachs, and that’s about it.」
＃Protagonist
「I guess so...」
Sigh... I'll look for something else.
Vegetables aren't going to be much help, after all.
This is... looks like rice.
With this much, we don't have to worry about running out of food, but it's completely useless in our current situation.
I'll look for something else.
If I want to eat rice, I should ask Narumi-san after we get out.
While rummaging through the cupboards, I found a hammer.
It's too short to reach whatever is blocking the door, but it looks like it could be useful for something.
I should probably keep it just in case.
There’s nothing else useful left in the cupboards.
A box full of nails came out of the shelf where miscellaneous goods were stored.
＃Protagonist
「Could we use these nails?」
＃Narumi
「Nails by themselves are useless.」
＃Protagonist
「I feel like they could be used for something, though...」
No choice, I'll take them and keep looking for something else.
Nails alone aren't going to help.

I tried opening the drawers, but they were full of junk and nothing particularly useful.
I'll look elsewhere.
There doesn't seem to be anything useful in here.
I found a small spoon in a drawer.
It was so tarnished I couldn't tell how long it had been left there, but it appeared to be silverware.
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, can we use this for something?」
＃Narumi
「A spoon? It’s nowhere near long enough.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
I'll see if there's anything else.
There doesn't seem to be anything useful in here.
A plain wooden wall.
When I touched it, there seemed to be quite a gap.
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san... maybe we can break through here.」
＃Narumi
「Break through...? Isn't the wall sturdy?」
Narumi-san peered at where my hand was.
＃Protagonist
「No... look, there's a gap here. If we peel off the wood, I think we’ll find dirt or some other fragile material...」
＃Narumi
「...Worst comes to worst, we’ll have to make a hole here.」
It looks like we could break through... but I have no idea how long it would take...
