When I returned to the hall with Narumi-san, Benio-san and Souko-san were there.
＃Protagonist
"How was it...?"
＃Benio
"No good. I asked Mother and Shion too, but she's nowhere to be found."
Benio-san shook her head.
＃Souko
"She might not even be inside the building..."
＃Protagonist
"But to go out in this snow..."
I asked the opposite of what I’d told Tsujimura-san.
I wanted Souko-san to solve that doubt.
＃Souko
"...Right. It's usually unthinkable, but... given the abnormal situation... I can't say the possibility is zero."
＃Protagonist
"No way... then we have to go out and search for her right now..."
＃Souko
"It's reckless. If she went out during the night, she's already far away. Besides, we can't risk a secondary accident."
＃Protagonist
"Then are you telling me to just give up!?"
＃Souko
"That's not it. ...Right now, we just have to believe."
＃Protagonist
"That might be true, but...!"
＃Benio
"Calm down, you idiot."
Benio-san grabbed my arm.
＃Benio
"It hasn't been decided that she went outside yet."
＃Protagonist
"But... then why can't we find her no matter how much we search?"
＃Benio
"Either she's hiding of her own will—or she's being hidden by someone else's will."
＃Protagonist
"Being hidden...?"
＃Benio
"...The possibility that she's already been killed."
＃Souko
"...Right."
Souko-san nodded at Benio-san's words.
＃Souko
"If she was caught by the killer... the possibility that she's still alive is extremely low."
＃Benio
"The question is why the killer targeted her..."
＃Souko
"Did she see something? For example, the killer's actions..."
＃Benio
"Hmm..."
＃Protagonist
"Um... is there no possibility that Akane-san is the killer?"
I blurted it out before I could think.
＃Souko
"Akane-san? ...I wonder."
＃Benio
"I don't think she could pull off something so bold... what do you think?"
With that, Benio-san directed the conversation to Narumi-san, who had been silent for a while.
＃Narumi
"Even if you ask me what I think... well, she's not a bad girl, but..."
＃Souko
"...It seems we won't be able to reach a conclusion yet."
＃Benio
"I suppose so..."
Souko-san and Benio-san nodded to each other.
＃Protagonist
"So all we can do is watch things play out...?"
＃Souko
"...That seems to be it."
Souko-san nodded with a pained expression.
