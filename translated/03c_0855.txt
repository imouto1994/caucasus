When I returned to the hall with Narumi-san, Benio-san and Souko-san were there.
#Main Character
"How was it...?"
#Benio
"No good. I asked Mother and Shion too, but she's nowhere to be found."
Benio-san shook her head.
#Souko
"She might not even be inside the building..."
#Main Character
"But to go out in this snow..."
I asked the opposite of what I’d told Tsujimura-san.
I wanted Souko-san to solve that doubt.
#Souko
"...Right. It's usually unthinkable, but... given the abnormal situation... I can't say the possibility is zero."
#Main Character
"No way... then we have to go out and search for her right now..."
#Souko
"It's reckless. If she went out during the night, she's already far away. Besides, we can't risk a secondary accident."
#Main Character
"Then are you telling me to just give up!?"
#Souko
"That's not it. ...Right now, we just have to believe."
#Main Character
"That might be true, but...!"
#Benio
"Calm down, you idiot."
Benio-san grabbed my arm.
#Benio
"It hasn't been decided that she went outside yet."
#Main Character
"But... then why can't we find her no matter how much we search?"
#Benio
"Either she's hiding of her own will—or she's being hidden by someone else's will."
#Main Character
"Being hidden...?"
#Benio
"...The possibility that she's already been killed."
#Souko
"...Right."
Souko-san nodded at Benio-san's words.
#Souko
"If she was caught by the killer... the possibility that she's still alive is extremely low."
#Benio
"The question is why the killer targeted her..."
#Souko
"Did she see something? For example, the killer's actions..."
#Benio
"Hmm..."
#Main Character
"Um... is there no possibility that Akane-san is the killer?"
I blurted it out before I could think.
#Souko
"Akane-san? ...I wonder."
#Benio
"I don't think she could pull off something so bold... what do you think?"
With that, Benio-san directed the conversation to Narumi-san, who had been silent for a while.
#Narumi
"Even if you ask me what I think... well, she's not a bad girl, but..."
#Souko
"...It seems we won't be able to reach a conclusion yet."
#Benio
"I suppose so..."
Souko-san and Benio-san nodded to each other.
#Main Character
"So all we can do is watch things play out...?"
#Souko
"...That seems to be it."
Souko-san nodded with a pained expression.
