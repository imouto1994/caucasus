Dawn broke.
＃Narumi
"...I'm exhausted..."
Leaning against the wall near the entrance of the Nanatsuki mansion, Narumi-san let out a yawn.
Without anyone saying a word, we had drifted outside.
It was still cold, but everyone likely felt it was better than being inside, where there were too many blind spots.
Everyone—though there were only four of us left, including me.
＃Tsujimura
"—There were footprints leading down toward the mountain stream."
Tsujimura-san returned from scouting the perimeter.
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san...?"
＃Tsujimura
"...Perhaps she fled along the river."
＃Narumi
"I hope she hasn't met with an accident... though it might be strange to say that about a murderer."
＃Protagonist
"No... I don't think so."
I hated the idea of everything remaining unknown like this.
But... surely, nothing will ever be understood.
Because we couldn't do anything.
Because I couldn't do anything—everyone died.
Takamine-san returned from the direction of the destroyed bridge.
＃Takamine
"People from below have reached the opposite bank. I've requested the police and workers to fix the bridge."
＃Tsujimura
"I see..."
＃Protagonist
"It looks like we won't be going home for a while..."
＃Takamine
"I intend to ask them to let us return as soon as possible, but... it may be difficult."
＃Narumi
"Still... somehow, it's over..."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... you're right..."
The tragedy had come to an end.
However, it was far from what one would call a 'conclusion'—
It was an ending that felt more like a 'cancellation.'
The Nanatsuki mansion had lost its inhabitants—
...And I had lost Souko-san.
