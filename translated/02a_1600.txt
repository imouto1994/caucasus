I returned to my room.
ÅîProtagonist
ÅuPhew...Åv
I flopped down onto the bed.
I feel strangely exhausted.
I suppose it's only natural... Rokuyou-san was killed this morning, and Ai-san was attacked at midday...
The culprit is likely still hiding somewhere, but at least I was able to save Ai-san.
I should at least be happy about that.
The culprit... who could it be?
I don't want to doubt anyone, but the culprit must undoubtedly be among the people I've met here.
If this series of crimes is related to the inheritance, it doesn't explain why Rokuyou-san was killed first.
After all, he had no right to the inheritance to begin with.
That being said, I haven't found any other clues that link the two incidents.
Other than the fact that Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were on good terms.
If only I could talk to Ai-san...
I closed my eyes.
I'll sleep... just for a bit.
I locked the door, so it should be fine.
Besides... I'm an outsider, so there's no reason for me to be targeted.
...Though that doesn't mean I can afford to be careless.
