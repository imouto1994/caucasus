Akane-san went to call people, and Souko-san, Dr. Mikanagi, and Tsujimura-san arrived and lowered Ai-san to the floor.
#Mikanagi
"I'm sorry, but..."
Dr. Mikanagi, who had checked Ai-san's pulse, shook his head.
#Souko
"...What happened?"
Souko-san asked.
#Protagonist
"............"
Unable to answer, I looked down.
#Souko
"...Akane-san, could you tell me what happened?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes..."
Akane-san was talking to Souko-san.
Even though Akane-san must be hurting too, she was answering bravely.
#Souko
"I see... it must have been tough."
Souko-san was comforting Akane-san.
#Souko
"...We're going to investigate."
Souko-san spoke to me.
#Protagonist
"Eh...?"
#Souko
"Don't 'Eh' me. We have to find the culprit somehow... otherwise the number of victims will only increase."
#Protagonist
"How could this..."
#Souko
"Don't just daze off, pull yourself together."
#Protagonist
"...Yes."
Rallied by Souko-san, I stood up.
Right beside me was Ai-san's body.
I offered a silent prayer for a moment, then turned back to Souko-san.
#Protagonist
"...Let's investigate."
#Souko
"Yes."
