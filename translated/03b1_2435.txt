Eventually, Tsujimura-san came running.
＃Tsujimura
"U-Um... Dr. Mikanagi has passed away..."
＃Protagonist
"Yes..."
＃Tsujimura
"Oh... how can this be... even Dr. Mikanagi..."
Tsujimura-san's shoulders slumped in despair.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, Shion-san is in the clinic. Her clothes are soiled, so please prepare a change for her."
＃Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... but why..."
＃Protagonist
"...Shion-san was the first to discover him."
＃Tsujimura
"Eh... she certainly... did say she was going to get some medicine, but..."
＃Protagonist
"...Please go let her change quickly."
＃Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... understood."
Tsujimura-san entered the clinic.
I... will investigate Dr. Mikanagi's room.
The only person capable of performing an autopsy is gone now, but there must be something I can do.
