「Attorney Takamine can be a bit rough with his language, but he's not a bad person.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「I hear Takamine-san used to come here since he was a child, brought along by his father.」
＃Protagonist
「Was that so?」
＃Benio
「Takamine is difficult. He likely can't settle down in a situation like this.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so?」
＃Tsujimura
「Takamine-sama is a serious person... He's someone who isn't afraid to have a differing opinion.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「What about me?」
＃Protagonist
「No, it's nothing...」
＃Mikanagi
「Takamine-san is headstrong. Perhaps that's why he's suited to being an attorney.」
