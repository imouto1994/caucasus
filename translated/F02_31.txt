"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei was nowhere to be seen.
I wonder if he’s gone somewhere else.

"Good morning, Mikanagi-sensei."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei, who had been at his desk, looked up.

"Ah, good morning."

"Do you have a moment?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, I don't mind."
Now then, what should I do.

"Do you have a moment?"
