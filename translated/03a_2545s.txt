Paintings are hanging on the walls, but the surfaces are covered in dust, making them hard to see.
I peered behind the frames as well, but nothing seemed to be there.
It doesn't seem like anything is hidden.
I opened the drawers, but they were empty.
It was as if they had been meticulously organized.
The drawers are empty.

I opened the drawer.
＃Protagonist
「Wait... a lid?」
There was another lid-like piece inside the drawer, blocking it.
There was only a marquetry pattern; no handle was attached.
Perhaps a piece of the marquetry had peeled off, as there was a depression in the center of the lid.
Based on the thickness of the drawer, there was no doubt a space below?
I tried to hook my finger onto the edge of the depression to lift it, but it wouldn't budge.
The drawer itself also didn't seem to come out of the desk.
＃Narumi
「Let me see.」
Narumi-san swapped places with me and peered into the drawer.
＃Narumi
「...I don't see a keyhole, but it seems to be locked. The way to open it... this part where the marquetry is missing looks suspicious.」
＃Protagonist
「You think so?」
＃Narumi
「Yeah. This part sinks in slightly. I bet if you fit a matching piece of marquetry into it, it'll unlock.」
＃Protagonist
「A matching piece...」
Did I have something like that?
It seems like it'll fit, but there's still something missing...

It seems like it'll fit, but there's still something missing...
Just a little more and it'll be completely filled...
Just a little more and it'll be completely filled...
Just a little more and it'll be completely filled...
Will this work...?
At any rate, it fit perfectly into the missing section.
＃Protagonist
「...Alright, I'll try pushing it.」
Holding the fragment in place, I pushed down lightly.
There was a clicking sound.
＃Protagonist
「Ah...」
Perhaps a spring was involved, as the lid popped up.
＃Narumi
「...It seems my hunch was correct.」
＃Protagonist
「...That was thanks to you, Narumi-san. You really are a master thief.」
＃Narumi
「You don't need to say that part.」
A single book was inside the drawer.
＃Protagonist
「This is... a music score.」
It was a carefully bound score.
The cover read, "Dedicated to my dear Marino."
＃Protagonist
「Marino...?」
＃Narumi
「What kind of song is it?」
＃Protagonist
「How should I know?」
＃Narumi
「I can't read music that well either... but this is likely in the Master's own hand. If it's an unpublished piece, it might be valuable.」
＃Protagonist
「So there's a possibility that *this* is the inheritance...」
＃Narumi
「I get the feeling it's something different, though...」
＃Protagonist
「Wait...」
No matter how I looked at it, it didn't seem to fit.
＃Narumi
「We can't spend all our time on this.」
＃Protagonist
「...I know.」
It's bothering me, but there's nothing I can do about it now.
How on earth do I get this lid off...?
I don't think there's anything else left to see.
＃Protagonist
「Hmm...?」
When I opened the drawer, a scrap of paper was inside.
I wonder what it is...
『A Certain Man's Story - Chapter 10』
?The man rounded his already hunched back even further and tried to leave the room sheepishly.
I called out to him.
「Please let me eat them again once you've learned to make delicious takoyaki. I'll be looking forward to it.」
Call me 'Old Man,' dammit... Hmph... trying to take pity on me when you're just a brat. Well, maybe I'll come by if I feel like it.
Leaving only those words behind, he vanished.
Still?those really were some terrible takoyaki. ~The End~
＃Protagonist
「...What is this?」
A scrap of paper titled "A Certain Man's Story - Chapter 10" is inside.
A beautiful card was peeking out from a gap between the bricks of the wall.
＃Protagonist
「What's this...?」
The card had a "K" written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll take it with me.
There's another piece of paper inside.
『Campaign currently in progress! Collect similar cards and answer the question! This is what the response section on the survey postcard was for!』
＃Protagonist
「...What is this?」
Well, I'm at least a little curious, so I'll hold onto this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
『You've collected all the cards! Now for the question... if you rearrange the letters you've collected, they form a certain word.』
『Translate that word into Japanese in a way that suits this work, and send in your survey postcard!』
『Deadline is January 11, 2010, postmarked! Ten winners will be chosen by lottery to receive a small gift!』
＃Protagonist
「...Sigh.」
I feel like I kind of get it, but I also kind of don't...
It doesn't seem like the bricks in the wall can be removed.
It appears to be an art book.
Nothing seems to be tucked inside.
Nothing in particular seems to be here.
It appears to be a poetry collection.
Nothing seems to be tucked inside.
Nothing seems particularly unusual.
It appears to be Mr. Kousei's diary.
I'll read it after I get back upstairs.
It's too dark to read here.
It looks like a photo, but it's completely faded, so I can't tell what was in it.
Even looking at the back, I don't see anything unusual.
It appears to be nothing.
The shelves were empty and just dusty.
It was as if everything had been disposed of?no, that might be exactly right.
After all, this was likely the last place Mr. Kousei spent his time before his suicide.
The shelves are empty.
