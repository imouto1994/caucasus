After Akane-san left, I stepped out of the room as well.
I was planning to ask Benio-san about the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'.
I was on my way back to my room after parting with Souko-san and the others.
#Protagonist
"Hmm...?"
I heard a loud noise.
Was it coming from the clinic...?
#Protagonist
"Is something wrong, Dr. Mikanagi—?"
I opened the door and gasped.
#Protagonist
"Sh-Shion-san!?"
#Shion
"Uu... uugh..."
Shion-san was lying on the floor, groaning in pain.
#Protagonist
"What happened, Shion-san!?"
#Shion
"Uu... ugh..."
A small, open bottle was lying on the floor nearby.
#Protagonist
"Don't tell me... poison!? Sh-Shion-san, stay with me!"
I hurriedly pulled her up and slapped her cheeks a few times.
#Shion
"Uugh..."
I have to do something...!
If she’s swallowed poison, I have to make her throw up first...
#Protagonist
"...Excuse me, Shion-san."
After a quick word, I slid my finger into her mouth.
#Shion
"Ugh...!"
I rubbed her back as she gagged.
#Shion
"Ugh... kof, kof!"
Saliva wetted the floor.
#Mikanagi
"What's wrong!?"
Dr. Mikanagi burst into the clinic.
#Protagonist
"It seems Shion-san swallowed poison or something!"
#Mikanagi
"What—!?"
Dr. Mikanagi immediately pulled Shion-san up.
#Mikanagi
"Shion-san, what did you take!?"
#Shion
"Uu... a-ah, m-med... icine..."
#Mikanagi
"Medicine? Your usual headache medicine?"
Shion-san nodded silently.
#Protagonist
"Was it this...?"
I showed the medicine bottle that had been lying on the floor to Dr. Mikanagi.
#Mikanagi
"This is... Shion-san, is your tongue numb?"
Shion-san nodded.
#Mikanagi
"...Tsk, bring some water."
#Protagonist
"A-Ah, right."
I scrambled up and brought the water pitcher and a cup from the desk.
#Mikanagi
"Drink this, we need to slow the absorption of the poison as much as possible."
Dr. Mikanagi poured the water from the cup into Shion-san's mouth.
#Protagonist
"W-Will she be alright...?"
I asked Dr. Mikanagi timidly.
#Mikanagi
"...I don't know yet. Aconite poison acts quickly and there's no antidote... we can only pray it works out."
#Protagonist
"Aconite!? Isn't that... a deadly poison?"
#Mikanagi
"...What was here was the crude drug 'Bushi', so it’s been treated to reduce toxicity... but it’s still dangerous if taken in large quantities."
As he spoke, Dr. Mikanagi continued to treat Shion-san.
#Mikanagi
"...But why would something like this happen..."
#Protagonist
"The culprit planted the poison, didn't they...?"
Dr. Mikanagi shook his head at my question.
#Mikanagi
"...I don't know. It’s possible I made a mistake in the formulation. I’d like to think not, but..."
#Protagonist
"How could that..."
#Mikanagi
"...Right now, Shion-san is more important than that."
Dr. Mikanagi was checking Shion-san's pulse.
#Mikanagi
"No signs of arrhythmia... I can only hope the amount was small... Let's move Shion-san to the bed. Help me."
#Protagonist
"Y-Yes."
Together, Dr. Mikanagi and I lifted Shion-san and moved her to the bed.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san..."
#Shion
"Ye... yes..."
Her lips were trembling slightly, but Shion-san managed to speak.
#Protagonist
"Do you know what happened...?"
#Shion
"I... took my usual medicine... and my tongue felt numb... I spat it out immediately... but..."
Shion-san spoke haltingly.
#Mikanagi
"I see... you should be alright now."
Dr. Mikanagi placed a wet towel on Shion-san's forehead.
#Protagonist
"...Was it really aconite?"
#Mikanagi
"...Of the medicines here, it’s the only one that would cause Shion-san's symptoms. But... it’s not something someone could do without considerable knowledge."
#Protagonist
"True..."
Someone like me wouldn't have a clue.
#Mikanagi
"...I wonder if I should tell everyone that Shion-san was targeted."
Dr. Mikanagi muttered quietly.
#Protagonist
"Are you planning not to tell them...?"
#Mikanagi
"I don't want to stir up unnecessary anxiety. Look... even Takamine-san is reluctant to eat, right? If that gets worse, it’ll be a disaster."
#Protagonist
"That’s true, but..."
#Mikanagi
"Why don't you decide? ...After all, I might be one of the suspects myself."
#Protagonist
"I don't... think that..."
But... it’s probably best to decide what to do.
Tell them Shion was targeted.
Don't tell them Shion was targeted.
#Mikanagi
"...I don't want to stir up unnecessary anxiety."
...He was certainly right about that.
#Protagonist
"...Let's keep the poisoning a secret, and just tell them what happened."
#Mikanagi
"Yes, that’s probably for the best."
That way, only Dr. Mikanagi, Shion-san, myself, and—the culprit—would know about the poison.
That could be a major key in tracking down the culprit later on.
#Protagonist
"...Let's not tell everyone."
#Mikanagi
"...That might be for the best. We'll just say Shion-san isn't feeling well and is resting."
#Protagonist
"Yeah, let’s go with that."
But... I should probably tell Souko-san.
I’m not quite capable enough to handle this situation on my own.
#Mikanagi
"Well then, I'll leave it to you."
#Protagonist
"Right, understood."
After checking on the lying Shion-san one last time, I left the clinic.
