I've come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san, it's me.」
The door opens, and Tsujimura-san peeks his head out.
＃Tsujimura
「Is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Do you have a moment?」
＃Tsujimura
「Sure, I don't mind. Please, come in.」
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I enter Tsujimura-san's room.
＃Tsujimura
「So, how can I help you?」
I've come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room again.
I knock on the door.
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, who is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「Ah, it's you. What is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Do you have a moment?」
＃Tsujimura
「Sure, I don't mind. Please, come in.」
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I enter Tsujimura-san's room.
＃Tsujimura
「How can I help you?」
I've come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... maybe he's not here.」
No matter how long I waited, there was no response.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
