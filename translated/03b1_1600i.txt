I wonder if this is enough.
#Souko
"...In the end, we didn't gain much."
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
Maybe Benio-san was killed because I was in the basement all that time.
Thinking about it that way makes it almost unbearable.
#Souko
"...At this stage, who do you think the culprit is?"
#Main Character
"Eh... me?"
#Main Character
"...There’s the possibility it’s you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Me? Why?"
#Main Character
"No, please don't be offended. I know there’s no motive or anything, and that it isn't you."
#Souko
"I see. Since I don't have an alibi either."
#Main Character
"Well... that’s how it is."
I had said it right in front of her, so it was very awkward.
#Souko
"It’s not bad to suspect those close to you first. Provided you have a proper reason."
Laughing, Souko-san patted my shoulder.
#Main Character
"Perhaps... it’s Benio-san."
#Souko
"Why? She’s already—"
#Main Character
"It’s just a possibility. There’s no proof that was Benio-san’s body."
#Souko
"...It’s rare to become unable to identify someone just because the head is missing. Even Dr. Mikanagi said for certain it was Benio-san."
#Main Character
"I see..."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Maya-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"...Honestly, I don't know. Maya-san is always in her room... but Benio-san is her own daughter, right?"
#Main Character
"...That’s the thing... but if the inheritance is involved..."
#Souko
"To lay hands even on her own daughter... I wonder?"
#Main Character
"I don't know. Since there’s no proof."
#Main Character
"...Is it possible Ai-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"That’s impossible. Since she’s already dead."
#Main Character
"...Right."
I have seen the dead Ai-san clearly with my own eyes.
There’s no way she would start moving from there.
#Souko
"Ai-san? ...But she died."
#Main Character
"But... there’s no proof that body was Ai-san... it had no head."
#Souko
"Then who are you saying it was?"
#Main Character
"That... I don't know, but..."
#Souko
"That’s a difficult point. If you want that theory to pass, you have to make it clear who that body was."
#Main Character
"...You’re right."
#Souko
"Ai-san? But she’s a victim too, isn't she?"
#Main Character
"...She might have faked it."
#Souko
"Hmm... as a possibility, it isn't non-existent, but I think it would be difficult."
#Main Character
"Is that so...?"
#Souko
"Shall we keep it in mind just in case?"
#Main Character
"Understood."
#Main Character
"...Is there a possibility Shion-san is the culprit...?"
#Souko
"...I wonder. I don't think she has that kind of nerve, but..."
#Main Character
"But... I don't think the possibility is zero."
#Souko
"...That might be true. Maybe she should be watched... but try not to provoke her carelessly."
#Main Character
"Yeah... I know."
#Main Character
"How about Tsujimura-san?"
#Souko
"...I see. He’s the younger brother of the late head, and he manages the master keys... it wouldn't be impossible for him to carry out everything so far..."
#Main Character
"However... he really doesn't look the part. And I don't think he harbors a grudge against Benio-san either..."
#Souko
"People don't kill only out of grudges. But well, since there’s no evidence or anything, it might be impossible to press him."
#Main Character
"Right..."
#Main Character
"...There’s no way Rokuyou-san is the culprit, right?"
#Souko
"Probably not. However... since we only confirmed a headless corpse... I suppose the possibility of a swap cannot be ruled out entirely."
#Main Character
"...If there were an extra body somewhere..."
#Souko
"There’s no way things would be that convenient, is there?"
#Main Character
"T-True..."
#Main Character
"...Is there a possibility Takamine-san is the culprit...?"
#Souko
"...Honestly, I don't know about that man. I feel like he’s hiding something, though..."
#Main Character
"There’s nothing that could be evidence, but should we be careful?"
#Souko
"Right... it’s better than doing nothing."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"...Is there a possibility Dr. Mikanagi is the culprit?"
#Souko
"That man? ...But well... if he’s performing the autopsies himself, he could fake as much as he wanted..."
#Main Character
"Exactly."
#Souko
"But then most of what we’ve investigated so far would become meaningless. Even things like the estimated time of death."
#Main Character
"That... would be a problem..."
#Souko
"We can't investigate it ourselves, and we likely just have to trust him, but..."
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
#Main Character
"Is it possible Akane-san is the culprit?"
#Souko
"Were there any suspicious points?"
#Main Character
"Well... she’s been acting strangely since last night..."
#Souko
"...Then I suppose it’s possible she went into hiding because of that..."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"...Perhaps Narumi-san is the culprit."
#Souko
"Did you see something?"
#Main Character
"No... it isn't exactly like that, but..."
It might be best to keep the fact that she’s a thief hidden for now.
#Souko
"It’s best not to suspect people carelessly, but..."
#Main Character
"...You’re right."
#Souko
"...For now, there are no powerful leads."
#Main Character
"...It’s not good to decide someone is the culprit based only on inference."
#Souko
"Exactly. We have to find definitive evidence."
#Main Character
"Yeah... I know. However... to find evidence, something else has to happen, doesn't it...?"
#Souko
"...I don't think this matter will end with this. We still haven't grasped the culprit’s purpose."
Souko-san muttered with a grave expression.
