I returned to my room for now.
Now, what should I do?
Spend time in my room
Look around the mansion
I don't have anything in particular to do, so I'll just kill some time here.
I lay down on the bed and closed my eyes.
With everything that's been happening since yesterday, I can't let my guard down for a single moment.
I'll take a quick look around the mansion.
