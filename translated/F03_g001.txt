「It's a story that comes up right away if you look into Nanatsuki Village. Though I couldn't find any documents that went into great detail.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Maya
「...I am aware that such rumors are circulating in the village. But I do not know the details.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「The 'Seven-Possession Curse', huh... fine by me. First, 'Item One: The fact that all heads of the Nanatsuki family meet unnatural deaths.' 'Item Two: The fact that no males are born into the Nanatsuki family.'」
＃Benio
「'Item Three: The matter of the disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Item Four: The fact that the manor is painted pitch black.' 'Item Five: The matter of the massive swarm of crows that covers the manor.'」
＃Benio
「'Item Six: The matter of the "Sacrifice of the Seven-Possession".' 'Item Seven: The matter of the ghost of the girl sacrificed wandering the manor.' ...That's all.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... thank you very much.」
＃Shion
「The Seven-Possession Curse... is it? ...I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「No, it's fine.」
＃Tsujimura
「I... don't know much about such things...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「I have no interest in such nonsense.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「A curse? ...Ah, that's just a rumor, right? I think Benio-san would know more about those kinds of stories.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「A curse? It's true they say all sorts of things in town... but if you want details, why not ask Lady Benio?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right.」
