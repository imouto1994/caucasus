I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
I don't really need to go right now...
I'll come back if I feel the urge.
I have no particular business here.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are kept.
It contains things like rags and buckets.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.

Of course, it's perfectly clean without any fogging.
A mirror hangs on the wall.
Cold water came out when I turned the faucet.
I suppose this time of year might be a bit rough.
The water has become very cold.
