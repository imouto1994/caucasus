I returned to the dining room.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, where's Souko-san?」
Souko-san was nowhere to be seen.
＃Benio
「It seems she went back to her room.」
Benio-san was relaxing while drinking cocoa.
Tsujimura-san and Narumi-san weren't there either.
＃Benio
「I suppose she can't settle down in a place where a murderer might be right next door.」
＃Protagonist
「How about you, Benio-san?」
＃Benio
「Me? ...Well, I suppose it's the same for me.」
＃Protagonist
「...Are you actually feeling anxious?」
＃Benio
「I am a delicate maiden, after all.」
Benio-san blurted out something quite unexpected.
No, she's right, of course, but she had an air about her that made it seem like she was somehow enjoying the situation.
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
Of course, I couldn't say that to her face, so I stayed silent.
With Rokuyou-san killed and Ai-san attacked, there's no telling when Benio-san might be targeted.
＃Protagonist
「...Please be careful too, Benio-san.」
＃Benio
「What's this? Are you that worried about me?」
The corners of Benio-san's mouth curled up.
＃Protagonist
「Of course I am.」
＃Benio
「...I see.」
Benio-san suddenly crossed her arms as if lost in thought.
＃Benio
「...Hey, are you—」
Benio-san's words were cut short by the sudden meowing of a cat.
＃Benio
「...Is Love worried too?」
＃Benio
「Hehe... I see.」
Benio-san picked up the cat.
＃Benio
「—I'll be heading back to my room as well.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so... Um, what you were about to say just now—」
＃Benio
「...It's nothing. Forget it.」
Benio-san turned her face away.
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Well then, see you later.」
Benio-san left the dining room.
I wonder what she wanted to say...
＃???
「...Um, are you finished?」
＃Protagonist
「Whoa!?」
Startled by the sudden voice, I turned around to find Akane-san standing there looking apologetic.
＃Protagonist
「A-Akane-san...」
＃Akane
「...I thought it would be rude to interrupt since the two of you seemed to be in your own little world...」
＃Protagonist
「...No, that wasn't the case at all...」
＃Akane
「I-Is that so...?」
How should I put it... this person is quite unusual too...
＃Akane
「Oh, that's right.」
Akane-san brought over a plate piled with fried rice.
＃Akane
「Um, I'd like you to take this to Takamine-sama...」
＃Protagonist
「Eh? But Takamine-san said he didn't want any...」
＃Akane
「Even if he says that, he needs to eat. Please tell him that the poison test has been done, so he can rest easy.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
Well, it might be better for me to take it rather than Akane-san or the others from this house.
