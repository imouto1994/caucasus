I returned to the dining room.
#Satoshi
"Oh, where's Souko-san?"
Souko-san was nowhere to be seen.
#Benio
"It seems she went back to her room."
Benio-san was relaxing while drinking cocoa.
Tsujimura-san and Narumi-san weren't there either.
#Benio
"I suppose she can't settle down in a place where a murderer might be right next door."
#Satoshi
"How about you, Benio-san?"
#Benio
"Me? ...Well, I suppose it's the same for me."
#Satoshi
"...Are you actually feeling anxious?"
#Benio
"I am a delicate maiden, after all."
Benio-san blurted out something quite unexpected.
No, she's right, of course, but she had an air about her that made it seem like she was somehow enjoying the situation.
#Satoshi
"...I see."
Of course, I couldn't say that to her face, so I stayed silent.
With Rokuyou-san killed and Ai-san attacked, there's no telling when Benio-san might be targeted.
#Satoshi
"...Please be careful too, Benio-san."
#Benio
"What's this? Are you that worried about me?"
The corners of Benio-san's mouth curled up.
#Satoshi
"Of course I am."
#Benio
"...I see."
Benio-san suddenly crossed her arms as if lost in thought.
#Benio
"...Hey, are you—"
Benio-san's words were cut short by the sudden meowing of a cat.
#Benio
"...Is Love worried too?"
#Benio
"Hehe... I see."
Benio-san picked up the cat.
#Benio
"—I'll be heading back to my room as well."
#Satoshi
"Is that so... Um, what you were about to say just now—"
#Benio
"...It's nothing. Forget it."
Benio-san turned her face away.
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"Well then, see you later."
Benio-san left the dining room.
I wonder what she wanted to say...
#???
"...Um, are you finished?"
#Satoshi
"Whoa!?"
Startled by the sudden voice, I turned around to find Akane-san standing there looking apologetic.
#Satoshi
"A-Akane-san..."
#Akane
"...I thought it would be rude to interrupt since the two of you seemed to be in your own little world..."
#Satoshi
"...No, that wasn't the case at all..."
#Akane
"I-Is that so...?"
How should I put it... this person is quite unusual too...
#Akane
"Oh, that's right."
Akane-san brought over a plate piled with fried rice.
#Akane
"Um, I'd like you to take this to Takamine-sama..."
#Satoshi
"Eh? But Takamine-san said he didn't want any..."
#Akane
"Even if he says that, he needs to eat. Please tell him that the poison test has been done, so he can rest easy."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
Well, it might be better for me to take it rather than Akane-san or the others from this house.
