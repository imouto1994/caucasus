"There was a similar case before...? But if no one died, it wouldn't be considered similar. It seems Tsujimura-san is hiding something..."
#Protagonist
"That might be true..."
#Maya
"A similar incident...? No, I have never heard of such a thing..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Ai
"A similar incident... it would be terrible if this happened repeatedly."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Benio
"You say something like this happened before... is that what Tsujimura said? ...In that case, it likely involves the 'Seven-Possession Curse'..."
#Protagonist
"That might be true..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That was... quite a long time ago..."
#Protagonist
"...Please tell me, Tsujimura-san. Even if it's from the past... what happened? It might be connected to what's happening now."
#Tsujimura
"B-But... I am sorry, I simply cannot..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Takamine
"A similar incident, huh..."
#Protagonist
"Do you know something?"
#Takamine
"...No, I don't."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Mikanagi
"A similar incident... I really can't say."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Akane
"Similar... No, sorry... I don't really know."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I'm not quite sure about that."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
