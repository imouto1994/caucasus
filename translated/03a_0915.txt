When I came down the stairs, Takamine-san and Tsujimura-san were there.
#Main Character
"Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Oh... is something wrong?"
#Takamine
"Did something happen?"
Sensing something from my frantic expression, Takamine-san asked.
#Main Character
"Yes... where is everyone?"
#Tsujimura
"Most of them should be in the main hall... I don't think the Madam, Shion-ojousama, or Dr. Mikanagi are there."
#Main Character
"I see... I have something to tell you, so would you mind coming too?"
#Takamine
"...Understood."
Takamine-san nodded and led the way to the western corridor where the main hall was.
I have to hurry.
Just as Tsujimura-san said, almost everyone was in the main hall.
Shion-san and Dr. Mikanagi couldn't be helped.
Was Maya-san still not feeling well?
#Benio
"What on earth is going on?"
#Main Character
"Yes, about that... Shion-san has been targeted by the culprit."
#Benio
"What!?"
#Ai
"What do you mean!?"
Ai-san, who had been sitting on the sofa, suddenly stood up and confronted me.
#Main Character
"W-Well..."
#Ai
"To think Shion would be attacked too! Why... why that child!?"
#Benio
"Calm down, Sister."
Benio-san intervened.
#Ai
"B-But!"
#Benio
"...What happened?"
Benio-san asked.
#Main Character
"...I don't know the details."
I was vague.
#Benio
"But—"
As Benio-san was about to press me further, Souko-san grabbed her shoulder.
#Souko
"...It’s not good to give everyone more information than necessary. Right?"
Souko-san asked me in a low voice, and I gave a small nod.
It seemed Souko-san had picked up on my intention.
#Benio
"Hmm... I see... But Shion is safe, right?"
#Main Character
"Yes... she's resting in the clinic now. But she needs absolute rest, so I think it's best if no one visits her for now."
I said this directed at Ai-san.
#Ai
"But..."
She looked like she was about to rush off at any moment.
#Benio
"Sister... please, bear with it. Shion is safe, so let's leave it at that for now."
#Ai
"I... I suppose..."
She didn't look convinced, but Ai-san managed to calm down.
Truthfully, she wasn't in "absolute rest" condition, but I wanted to avoid things getting complicated by people meeting and talking.
#Souko
"Well then, about what we do next—"
#Main Character
"...We might have no choice but to carry on as we have been."
#Souko
"Right... We’ll just have to ask everyone to stay in their rooms as much as possible. Although we can't exactly force them..."
#Benio
"If you don't want to die... that's all we can say."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
In that case, Takamine-san’s decision to stay cooped up in his room might be the smartest move.
#Souko
"Are you going to keep investigating?"
#Main Character
"...Of course. Even Shion-san has been targeted."
#Souko
"...Right. I'll help as much as I can... but please, be careful."
We arrived at the front of Souko-san's room.
I gave a light knock on the door.
#Main Character
"Souko-san, it's me."
The door opened and Souko-san peered out.
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Main Character
"I have something to tell you..."
#Souko
"...Come in."
Following Souko-san into the room.
#Souko
"Did something happen?"
Souko-san asked, holding a bottle of cola.
#Main Character
"Yes... Shion-san was targeted by the culprit."
#Souko
"Eh... really?"
#Main Character
"It seems poison was used. We managed to avoid the worst, but..."
#Souko
"I see..."
Souko-san placed the bottle on the table.
#Main Character
"I haven't told the others because I don't want to cause unnecessary panic..."
#Souko
"That's probably for the best. If they knew poison was being used, no one would be able to eat."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Even so... the method has changed..."
Souko-san spoke as she fell into thought.
#Main Character
"True... Rokuyou-san was decapitated, and Ai-san was strangled..."
#Souko
"Right. To suddenly go for poisoning now... don't you think it's strange?"
#Main Character
"But Shion-san was suffering from the poison... I wonder if there’s something about the neck."
#Souko
"...It might be the same if the cause of death was respiratory failure... but..."
#Main Character
"...Perhaps the plan was to decapitate her after she died. Just like with Ai-san..."
#Souko
"...It's hard to say. Only Rokuyou-san was decapitated. I don't think there’s any chance the other two were meant to be decapitated as well."
#Main Character
"Is that so..."
#Souko
"Then let me ask, what would be the reason for decapitating them?"
#Main Character
"True, both Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were decapitated..."
And Benio-san too...
#Souko
"Right. To suddenly go for poisoning now... don't you think it's strange?"
#Main Character
"...Perhaps the plan was to decapitate Shion-san after she died."
#Souko
"Given everything so far, that’s highly likely... but if that’s the case, what’s the reason for decapitating them?"
#Main Character
"True... both Rokuyou-san and Benio-san were decapitated..."
#Main Character
"True, Rokuyou-san was decapitated..."
#Souko
"And now an attempted poisoning... don't you think it's strange?"
#Main Character
"...Perhaps the plan was to decapitate Shion-san after she died."
#Souko
"That might be true... but if that’s the case, what’s the reason for decapitating them?"
#Main Character
"The reason... huh..."
A headless corpse—what could it signify...?
#Main Character
"...I wonder if it has something to do with the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'..."
#Souko
"...It might."
Souko-san took a sip from her cola bottle.
#Souko
"...But it’s almost a miracle that she survived after taking poison."
#Main Character
"I assume the amount wasn't a lethal dose..."
#Souko
"But then... doesn't that mean there was no intention to actually kill her?"
#Main Character
"Eh... what do you mean by that...?"
#Souko
"I don't know the reason. But... I just get that feeling."
Souko-san muttered with a serious expression.
