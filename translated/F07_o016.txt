"'Akane' and 'Akari', huh... I don't know about anyone else, but I doubt someone would ever mistake their own name..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"...I am sorry, I do not really know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"...I'm sorry, I don't really know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"Isn't it strange to use 'M' as the initial for 'Hiyama'? If you made that much of a mistake, you'd notice, and normally you'd just start over."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Mistakes do happen... For instance, Lady Benio writes her name as 'Venio' in romanized spelling, you see."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I can't really tell."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"...I'm sorry, but I don't really know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"...That's the handkerchief from yesterday."
#Satoshi
"Akane-san said she made a mistake, but I can't believe that. Who on earth is 'Akari M'...?"
#Mikanagi
"...I know one person with a name that matches that."
#Satoshi
"...The person in the photo in your room?"
#Mikanagi
"...You saw it."
#Satoshi
"...Sorry."
#Mikanagi
"There's no need to apologize. I'm the one who sent you to get the bag."
#Satoshi
"So... is it her?"
#Mikanagi
"...She is Akari Misono, the person I cared for most."
#Satoshi
"Was she someone who worked here?"
#Mikanagi
"...Until a while ago."
#Satoshi
"But if it's her... why does Akane-san have it..."
#Mikanagi
"...Regarding that, it would be better to ask Akane-san. Besides, there's no guarantee the embroidery on that handkerchief refers to her."
#Satoshi
"True... I understand."
#Akane
"L-Like I said! I told you yesterday I just made a mistake...!"
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Akane
"That's... I'm sorry, I can't right now..."
#Satoshi
"I see... I understand."
#Narumi
"...I don't think that girl can embroider, though... Did she really sew it herself?"
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
