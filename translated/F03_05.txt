＃Tsujimura
「Oh, is something the matter?」
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
＃Protagonist
「Hello. Were you in the middle of work?」
＃Tsujimura
「Not at all. Did you need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Well...」
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, what's the matter this time?」
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
＃Protagonist
「Well...」
Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were in the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「I thought I'd do a quick patrol of the manor. It would be terrible if something happened again.」
＃Tsujimura
「I see. ...No, truly, that is likely a task I ought to be performing myself...」
＃Protagonist
「No, it's more helpful if you stay here, Tsujimura-san. It's probably better for Shion-san to have someone nearby as well.」
＃Shion
「Yes... that's true.」
Now then, I'd like to ask some questions, but I wonder which one I should ask.
Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were in the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, is there something else?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes...」
I'd like to ask one of them some questions.
I came to the office, but Tsujimura-san didn't seem to be there.
There's no point in staying here if no one's around, but...
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, is something the matter?」
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
＃Akane
「Tsujimura-san, have you seen Lady Ai?」
＃Tsujimura
「Lady Ai...? Wouldn't she be in her room?」
＃Protagonist
「The thing is... she isn't there.」
＃Tsujimura
「If she isn't in her room... then I'm afraid I wouldn't know...」
＃Protagonist
「I see... thank you.」
＃Akane
「Let's look somewhere else.」
We parted ways with Tsujimura-san and decided to search another location.
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Did you find Lady Ai?」
＃Protagonist
「No... not yet.」
＃Tsujimura
「I'll let her know you were looking for her if I happen to see her.」
＃Akane
「Thank you very much.」
We decided to search for Ai-san in a different location.
Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were in the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Have you seen Ai-san?」
＃Tsujimura
「Lady Ai, you say...? Lady Shion, do you know anything?」
＃Shion
「Sister Ai... No, I haven't seen her.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see. Please let me know if you see her.」
＃Shion
「Yes... I understand.」
＃Akane
「Let's try looking somewhere else.」
＃Protagonist
「Right. ...Please excuse us.」
We decided to search elsewhere.
Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were still in the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Did you find Lady Ai?」
＃Protagonist
「No... not yet.」
＃Akane
「Let's try looking somewhere else.」
＃Protagonist
「Right. ...Please excuse us.」
We decided to search elsewhere.
I came to the office.
＃Akane
「Tsujimura-san doesn't seem to be here.」
＃Protagonist
「It seems so.」
I took a quick look around the office, but of course, there was no sign of Ai-san.
＃Akane
「Let's look somewhere else.」
Following Akane-san's lead, we decided to head elsewhere.
