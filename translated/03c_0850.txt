As I turned around, I ran into Narumi-san coming out of the chapel.
#Main Character
"Oh, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"...She wasn't here either."
Narumi-san shook her head.
#Main Character
"Did you unlock it?"
#Narumi
"I've checked almost all the locked rooms, not just this one, but she's nowhere to be found."
#Main Character
"Um... did you check Kousei-san's room on the second floor?"
#Narumi
"Ah... yes, just in case. But she wasn't there."
#Main Character
"I see..."
Where on earth could she have gone...?
#Narumi
"...Let's head back for now."
#Main Character
"...Yeah. Benio-san is searching as well, so let's hear what she has to say."
