As I turned around, I ran into Narumi-san coming out of the chapel.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Narumi-san.」
＃Narumi
「...She wasn't here either.」
Narumi-san shook her head.
＃Protagonist
「Did you unlock it?」
＃Narumi
「I've checked almost all the locked rooms, not just this one, but she's nowhere to be found.」
＃Protagonist
「Um... did you check Kousei-san's room on the second floor?」
＃Narumi
「Ah... yes, just in case. But she wasn't there.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
Where on earth could she have gone...?
＃Narumi
「...Let's head back for now.」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah. Benio-san is searching as well, so let's hear what she has to say.」
