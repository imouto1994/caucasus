"This way."
We went up the stairs and proceeded along the passage surrounding the atrium.
Beyond that, there was an inconspicuous door.
#Tsujimura
"There's a ladder inside that leads to the attic room above."
#Protagonist
"...Let's go."
I took the lead and stepped inside.
I climbed the ladder, the sound of my footsteps echoing.
It was pitch black and I couldn't see a thing.
When I reached the top, I could tell there was a door nearby.
A tiny bit of light was filtering in through a small window in the door, perhaps from outside.
I peeked inside.
#Protagonist
"Eh..."
I had opened the door before my mind could even process what I was looking at.
A sharp smell of blood hung in the air.
A human body, lying sprawled on the floor.
Blood, soaking the floor.
A hand axe, discarded.
#Protagonist
"A... Ai-san...?"
#Tsujimura
"A... aahh, Miss Ai..."
Tsujimura-san fell to his knees.
#Souko
"This is... horrible."
Frowning, Souko-san entered the attic room.
#Souko
"...The clothes she's wearing are the same. But without a head... I can't be sure if it's really her."
#Protagonist
"What do you mean... who else could it possibly be!?"
It's undoubtedly Ai-san.
#Souko
"Calm down. ...Tsujimura-san, could you go call Dr. Mikanagi?"
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... right away."
Tsujimura-san stood up and left the room.
#Souko
"...I think it's Ai-san too. But..."
And then, Souko-san looked around.
#Souko
"...Where's the head?"
#Protagonist
"Eh..."
I also looked around the room.
A small attic room that was by no means spacious.
Within my field of vision, Ai-san's head was nowhere to be found.
#Protagonist
"...Is it the same... as with Rokuyou-san...?"
#Souko
"Likely..."
Souko-san bit her lower lip.
I heard the sound of someone climbing the ladder from outside the room.
#Mikanagi
"............"
Dr. Mikanagi, who had hurried into the room, let out a breath.
#Mikanagi
"So... it's come to this..."
After we offered a silent prayer, Souko-san spoke up.
#Souko
"...Let's investigate. We can't just leave her lying here forever."
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
