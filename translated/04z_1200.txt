On the morning of the fourth day since our arrival, the driver from the foot of the mountain found the destroyed suspension bridge as planned.
Benio-san, who had gone to check on the situation on the opposite bank, negotiated with him, and the driver returned to bring back a police officer and several laborers by early afternoon.
They hurriedly constructed a scaffold, and by the time they had managed to span a bridge wide enough for one person and the officer crossed over, it was already evening.
＃Police Officer
"How shall we proceed, Madam...?"
＃Maya
"……Even if she is a daughter of the Nanatsuki family, the fact remains that she committed a crime. I ask for a strict and just judgment."
＃Police Officer
"I-I see... however, I have been instructed by the Chief to ensure that no discourtesy is shown..."
＃Protagonist
"The officer is being awfully subservient..."
＃Mikanagi
"It can't be helped. There isn't a policeman alive who can stand up to the Nanatsuki family."
＃Souko
"I suppose it's inevitable. In a rural place like this, the word of the powerful is absolute."
＃Benio
"Shion will likely be released without even a mention in the newspapers. They still have that much influence left."
＃Protagonist
"I... I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing..."
＃Mikanagi
"Shion-san has continued to maintain her silence, after all..."
＃Souko
"Shion-san hasn't said a word since it happened, has she...?"
＃Benio
"……That being said, we can't exactly act as if nothing happened. ……Shion will likely spend the rest of her life in confinement."
＃Protagonist
"That's..."
＃Mikanagi
"……This family has always functioned that way."
＃Souko
"……In a sense, nothing ever changes here, does it...?"
＃Benio
"This is a worthless world."
Benio-san spat out the words in a mutter.
＃Tsujimura
"Thank you for waiting."
Tsujimura-san appeared, accompanied by Shion-san.
Shion-san looked utterly haggard, her gaze fixed constantly on the floor.
＃Maya
"……Now then, I leave her in your care."
＃Police Officer
"Understood, Madam."
The officer gave a salute.
＃Tsujimura
"……Let us go, Shion-ojousama."
＃Shion
"……Yes."
＃Souko
"……Well then, shall we get going too? They said they can give us a ride to the foot of the mountain."
Souko-san picked up her luggage.
It seemed much lighter now that the cola bottles were gone.
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
＃Benio
"I'd say 'come again'... but that's a hard thing to say. Yeah... let's meet again someday."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... let's do that."
＃Souko
"Oh, that's right. Here, take this."
Souko-san handed a bottle of cola that hadn't been opened yet to Benio-san.
＃Protagonist
"You still had some left!?"
＃Souko
"……What's with that surprised look on your face?"
Well, I was surprised, which is why I looked like that.
＃Benio
"Thank you. I shall drink it with care."
＃Protagonist
"……The carbonation will go flat, so you should probably drink it soon after you open it."
＃Ai
"Shion!!"
As we were about to step outside from the entrance, Ai-san ran up to Shion-san.
＃Shion
"Ai-oneesama..."
＃Ai
"Shion... Shion...!"
＃Shion
"Please do not cry, Ai-oneesama..."
Shion-san gently stroked Ai-san's head.
It was a scene that made it look as if the order of the sisters had been reversed.
＃Benio
"……My sister loves Shion, after all."
Benio-san muttered quietly.
＃Benio
"Sister, that's enough."
＃Ai
"But... but...!"
＃Shion
"Oneesama..."
＃Benio
"Don't worry, she'll be back soon. ……Right?"
＃Police Officer
"Y-Yes, that is correct, ma'am!"
The officer replied while standing at attention.
＃Ai
"Shion... please, take care of yourself."
＃Shion
"Yes..."
Outside, the snow had completely stopped.
＃Souko
"They said there's a vehicle waiting on the other side of the bridge."
＃Protagonist
"It's not a carriage?"
＃Souko
"Apparently there's a four-wheel-drive truck that brought the materials."
＃Protagonist
"Well, as long as we can get back, anything is fine at this point."
＃Souko
"Exactly. Well then, shall we head home?"
＃Benio
"……You are going as well?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
＃Benio
"……So I've been left all alone."
＃Protagonist
"Since Souko-san is gone as well..."
＃Benio
"……Are you going to be okay?"
＃Protagonist
"……Yeah, don't worry about me."
Outside, the snow had completely stopped.
Apparently, a truck was waiting across the bridge.
Since we were told we could hitch a ride to the foot of the mountain, let's take it.
After walking for a bit, I turned back.
Beyond the black mansion, I could see a white sky.
I will never forget the events of these past few days.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san... goodbye."
