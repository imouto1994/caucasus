The fire in the fireplace is still burning.
There doesn't seem to be anything unusual.
I don't see anything strange about the fireplace.
This is the door connected to my room.
It doesn't seem to have any problems.
Everything seems normal here.
It's pure white outside the window; I can't see anything.
I wonder when this blizzard will stop...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
Fresh blood is splattered across the sheets.
It's not a pleasant sight.
Splashes of blood are clinging to the sheets.
Dr. Mikanagi's remains lying on the bed.
The head was left behind.
The blood overflowing from the severed neck hasn't dried yet.
That makes sense—he was talking to me just a short while ago.
There's no need to even investigate the estimated time of death.
...It seems I'm starting to break down, too.
Looking even at the severed surface of Dr. Mikanagi's neck, I can even predict that it was cut with something like a saw.
Was the culprit trying to decapitate him?
If so, it's the same as before, but—
How many times do they have to repeat this before they're satisfied—
Did the culprit intend to sever the head...?
Fresh blood is splattered throughout the room.
There were several handprints on Dr. Mikanagi's white coat.
Will this—be important evidence, or—
They're likely Shion-san's handprints.
She saw Dr. Mikanagi, and in her shock, she rushed to him and touched him—
The clothes wouldn't be that soiled unless she touched them.
That's the interpretation if one views it favorably.
But—what if that wasn't the case...?
...Shion-san was also stained with blood.
＃Protagonist
「Another snowdrop...」
A single white flower was fallen on the floor.
Enough already... I want this to end...
＃Protagonist
「This flower is...」
A single white flower was fallen on the floor.
Why in a place like this...?
A snowdrop flower is lying there.
In this place—no, a single-edged saw, which doesn't belong in Dr. Mikanagi's room, is lying there.
Bloody handprints were clearly adhering to it.
So this is...
