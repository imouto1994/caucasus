I’ve come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
As expected, she isn't here.
I wonder where on earth Akane-san could be...
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while.
＃Narumi
「Yes... oh, it's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, how is Akane-san's condition?」
＃Narumi
「No need to worry. She should be able to move around again soon.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「Really, I'm just glad it wasn't more serious.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, you're right. Well, I'll leave Akane-san in your hands.」
＃Narumi
「Got it.」
I bowed to Narumi-san and decided to head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while.
＃Narumi
「Yes... oh, it's you again. What is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「No, I don't really have any business, but...」
＃Narumi
「Do you want to talk to Akane?」
Narumi-san opened the door wide.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, no, as long as she's okay, that's enough.」
Akane-san looked well enough from the glimpse I caught, so I decided to leave.
