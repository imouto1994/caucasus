......Hm?
I heard a sound.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san?"
I sat up and looked at the bed.
#Souko
"Mmn..."
She seemed to still be asleep.
Looking at the clock, it was just past 2:00 AM.
About an hour had passed since I'd fallen asleep.
I felt like it had been a fairly loud noise.
I wondered where it had come from...
[Somewhere on the first floor]
[Somewhere on the second floor]
[From outside]
Was it the first floor?
Since I'd heard it while lying down, that seemed likely.
It was bugging me... maybe I'll go take a look.
Leaving Souko-san behind, I stepped out of the room.
The hallway was deathly silent.
The air felt cold and stagnant.
I headed toward the stairs.
Was it from the second floor?
It was bugging me... I'll go take a look.
Leaving Souko-san behind, I stepped out of the room.
The hallway was deathly silent.
The air felt cold and stagnant.
There was no sign of Mikanagi-sensei next door waking up.
Maybe it wasn't here.
That said, the wing where Maya-san and the others stayed was a bit further away.
If it was coming from there...
But well, I'll do a little investigating.
I headed toward the atrium in the center of the mansion.
Was it... outside?
I walked over to the window and looked out.
The wind seemed to have picked up again.
The window was rattling, but that wasn't the sound.
I felt like it had been a much heavier sound.
The tower caught my eye.
Its resident was currently in the chapel on the first floor.
Maybe I'll go take a look...
The door would surely be locked anyway, so it wasn't like I'd be able to see her.
I stepped out of the room, careful not to wake Souko-san.
I went down the stairs and into the north hallway.
It was deathly silent here as well.
The large door straight ahead was closed.
Nothing—nothing was out of the ordinary.
#Protagonist
"—!?"
I spun around at a noise.
#Protagonist
"Eh...?"
It looked like Benio-san's cat was nearby.
It was so dark I couldn't tell where it was...
The sound of its bell faded into the distance.
It had given me a bit of a start, but...
#???
"—Is something the matter?"
#Protagonist
"—!?"
A voice called out from behind me, and I spun around again, startled once more.
#Protagonist
"Ah... Tsujimura-san. Um... I was just a bit worried about Shion-san..."
I decided to tell the truth.
#Tsujimura
"The young lady...? Haha, there's no need to worry. The door is securely locked."
#Protagonist
"Y-yeah, you're right."
I wondered what exactly I was so worried about.
Before I reached the stairs, I noticed someone in the hall.
That was...
#Tsujimura
"Oh, are you still awake?"
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san..."
Tsujimura-san was looking up at me.
#Protagonist
"I was just thinking of heading to the restroom."
I told a lie.
#Tsujimura
"Ah, my apologies for stopping you."
#Protagonist
"No, it's fine."
I headed down the stairs.
