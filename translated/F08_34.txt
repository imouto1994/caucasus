I step outside through the door in the back of the office and walk through the garden where the snow continues to fall, approaching the tower.
It's incredibly cold.
Was heading out in such light clothing a mistake after all?
The area around the tower door was thoroughly cleared of snow.
When I put my hand to the door, it opened easily.
In other words, she must be in her room.
I go inside, brush the snow off my body, and head up the stairs.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Shion-san peeks her head out with an anxious look.
#Shion
"Is something the matter...?"
#Satoshi
"Um, do you know anything about Kirihara?"
#Shion
"Mistress Kirihara... did something happen?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah... she's been missing for a little while now."
#Shion
"No way..."
Shion-san's face turns pale.
#Satoshi
"Have you been here the whole time, Shion-san?"
#Shion
"Y-Yes..."
#Satoshi
"...Then there's no way you would have seen Souko-san."
#Shion
"True... This place is isolated, after all."
#Satoshi
"Please let me know immediately if anything happens."
#Shion
"...Yes, understood."
I've come to the front of Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
#Shion
"Um, was there something else...?"
#Satoshi
"I still haven't found Souko-san, so..."
#Shion
"I see... Where could she have gone...?"
#Satoshi
"Do you know of any places she could hide?"
#Shion
"I... don't know any."
Shion-san shakes her head.
#Satoshi
"I'll try looking a bit more. You never know what might happen, so please be careful too, Shion-san."
#Shion
"...You take care as well."
