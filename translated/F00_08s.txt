The world outside the window is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.

"Hm...?"
A scrap of paper has fallen under one of the chairs.
What could this be...?
'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Two'
Yes, that was back when I was holding a concert in Ueno. Even now, I cannot forget that terrifying experience. I remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday.
And those eyes... clouded with a terrifying grey... they were undoubtedly the eyes of one who had slaughtered many on the battlefield.
Furthermore, he possessed a complex gaze that seemed to cry out from some profound loneliness; it left me with an indescribably ominous and eerie impression.
Looking back now, I realize that allowing that stall to operate near the venue was the beginning of everything.
I had crossed paths with a man whose eyes held both obsession and madness. ~To be continued~

"...What the hell is this?"
A scrap of paper titled 'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Two' lies on the floor.
An incredibly expensive-looking painting is on display.
I have no idea who painted it.
That really is a pricey-looking painting...
The fire in the hearth has been extinguished.
There should be no problem investigating it.
I clear away the accumulated ash and peer deep into the chimney, but I find nothing out of the ordinary.

"...Doesn't look like it's here."

"So it seems. Let's search elsewhere."
It appears that this is not the place.
The tabletop has been cleared off neatly.
The table is tidy and clean.
