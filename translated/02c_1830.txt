By the time I returned to the hall, a crowd had gathered.
＃Takamine
「What happened?」
Takamine-san asked.
＃Souko
「Yes…… it seems the generator was tampered with.」
＃Mikanagi
「Whatever for……?」
＃Benio
「Doctor, first we're going to confirm everyone's safety.」
Benio-san cut Dr. Mikanagi off and spoke up.
＃Benio
「Lawyer Takamine and the Doctor are here. Where are Mother and the others?」
＃Mikanagi
「Maya-san is in the drawing room. Narumi-san and Akane-san are there as well.」
＃Benio
「……Where are my sister and Shion?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Ai-san should be in her room.」
＃Benio
「Hmm…… I see. Then let's go check.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, understood.」
I nodded and headed up the stairs with Benio-san.
