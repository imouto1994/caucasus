I've come to the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Oh, what's up?"
Narumi-san was washing dishes with a listless air.
#Protagonist
"Ah, were you in the middle of work?"
#Narumi
"I'm technically working, but... oh, I know, why don't you help me with the dishes?"
#Protagonist
"Eh!? Me...?"
#Narumi
"There's no one else, is there? It's such a pain doing it by myself, don't you think?"
What should I do...
Help
Don't help
#Protagonist
"All right."
Well, I'm bored anyway, so a little bit should be fine.
#Narumi
"Then I'll leave the rest to you."
With that, Narumi-san sat down in a chair.
#Protagonist
"Wait, Narumi-san?"
#Narumi
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"What about washing the dishes?"
#Narumi
"That's why I said I'm leaving it to you, so do your best."
#Protagonist
"...*Sigh*"
Well, I'm the one who said I'd help, so I guess I have no choice.
I turn on the water at the tap and wash the dishes.
#Narumi
"The water's cold, right? It's tough this time of year."
Narumi-san is snacking on leftovers from dinner.
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
I give a vague reply while silently washing the dishes.
If I focus on how cold the water is, my hands feel like they'll stop.
#Narumi
"By the way, what did you come here for?"
#Protagonist
"Uh... well..."
#Protagonist
"I'm sorry, I just remembered I have something to do."
I bowed while taking a few steps back.
#Narumi
"Hey, that's obviously a lie! Wait!"
With Narumi-san's shouts at my back, I fled the kitchen.
I've come to the kitchen again.
#Narumi
"Oh, you need something again?"
#Protagonist
"Uh... well..."
I've come to the kitchen.
#Protagonist
"Huh... no one's here."
The place was empty, and Narumi-san was nowhere to be seen.
If she's not here, there's nothing I can do.
What should I do...
