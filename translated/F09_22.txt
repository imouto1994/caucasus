Opposite Benio-san's room.
This room, which used to be vacant, is now Souko-san's room.
I wonder if she's there...
The door opened before I could even knock.
#Narumi
"Oh... what's up?"
It was Narumi-san who came out.
#Satoshi
"And what are *you* doing here, Narumi-san?"
#Narumi
"Kirihara-san is changing rooms, so I was tidying up."
#Satoshi
"...You weren't rummaging through her things, were you?"
#Narumi
"I'd never do something as vulgar as sifting through a guest's luggage."
I feel like I'm being told something that doesn't quite sit right...
#Narumi
"If it's Kirihara-san you're looking for, she's probably in the room she was using before."
#Satoshi
"I see. Thank you."
I'll go check things out for a bit.
Opposite Benio-san's room.
This room, which used to be vacant, is now Souko-san's room.
I wonder if she's there...
#Satoshi
"Souko-san, it's me."
The person who appeared from behind the door was Narumi-san.
#Narumi
"Kirihara-san hasn't come back yet."
#Satoshi
"Ah... I see."
It can't be helped, I'll come back later.
Opposite Benio-san's room.
This room, which used to be vacant, is now Souko-san's room.
I wonder if she's there...
I knock and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
I wonder if she's somewhere else.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
Opposite Benio-san's room.
This room, which used to be vacant, is now Souko-san's room.
I wonder if she's there...
#Satoshi
"Souko-san, it's me."
#Souko
"Oh, what's up?"
Souko-san showed her face.
#Satoshi
"Do you have a moment?"
#Souko
"I suppose so."
With that, Souko-san invited me into the room.
#Souko
"So, what do you need?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
Souko-san's room, which moved to opposite Benio-san's room.
I wonder if she's there...
#Satoshi
"Souko-san, it's me."
#Souko
"Oh, it's you again. What's up?"
#Satoshi
"Can we talk for a bit?"
#Souko
"Yeah, sure."
With that, Souko-san invited me into the room.
#Souko
"What is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
