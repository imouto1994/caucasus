I wandered out of the kitchen, and before I knew it, I had reached the hall.
...Souko-san is dead.
What do I do now...?
I'd been relying on Souko-san for everything, so her being gone felt like a gaping hole had been punched into my heart...
I can't do anything alone...
#Benio
"So this is where you were."
Benio-san approached me.
#Protagonist
"Benio-san..."
#Benio
"Pull yourself together, you moron."
#Protagonist
"But... without Souko-san, I'm nothing..."
A sharp, hot impact struck my cheek.
#Protagonist
"Eh...?"
#Benio
"I told you to pull yourself together! Do you not even have the spirit to avenge her!?"
#Protagonist
"Benio-san... but..."
#Benio
"At the very least, as far as I can see, you were doing your best! So... I know it's hard, but please, keep it together..."
...She's right.
Benio-san lost her sister, Ai-san, too.
She must be suffering herself, and yet she's trying to encourage me...
#Protagonist
"Benio-san, I..."
#Benio
"Don't let me hear that pathetic voice. First, we'll start questioning everyone and look into their actions around the time she disappeared."
#Protagonist
"Y-Yes!"
