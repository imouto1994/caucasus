I arrived at Takamine-san's room on the north side of the first floor.

「Takamine-san, it's me.」
I knocked on the door and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
Is he not there... or has he already gone to sleep...
Staying here like this isn't going to get me anywhere.
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
