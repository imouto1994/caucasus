We walked down the corridor in the east wing of the first floor and arrived at the grand dining hall.
#Akane
"We've been expecting you. Please, take these seats."
Akane-san, who had come to meet us, led the way and showed us to our spots at the table.
The table was obscenely long and narrow.
I'd seen things like this in foreign movies, but I never imagined I'd actually be sitting at one.
#Souko
"Don't just stand there in a daze, sit down."
Souko-san poked me in the ribs.
#Protagonist
"...I can't help it, I feel a little intimidated."
#Souko
"Don't you dare say you'd be more comfortable with a low table on a tatami mat. It's embarrassing."
Souko-san sat herself down without a second thought.
A moment later, I took my seat as well.
It looked like everyone we had met in the house so far was already there.
#Akane
"Would you like something to drink?"
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'll have—"
#Souko
"A cola, please."
Souko-san cut me off and ordered exactly what I expected.
#Akane
"C-cola...?"
Akane-san tilted her head in confusion.
#Souko
"Yeah. Do you have any?"
#Akane
"U-um..."
Akane-san looked at me, clearly troubled.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, don't be unreasonable. You could have just brought yours from the room."
There was no way a house like this would have cola in stock.
#Souko
"Uuu..."
Souko-san started to sulk.
#Akane
"U-um, shall I go and fetch it for you?"
Unable to bear the awkwardness, Akane-san offered to help.
#Souko
"No, it's fine. I can manage for a little while."
#Akane
"I-I see..."
I was worried that Akane-san would get the wrong idea and think cola was some kind of legendary beverage.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, do you want the cola you brought?"
I held out the bottle she had handed me earlier in the hall.
#Souko
"Oh, right! I'm so glad I brought it along."
A bright smile returned to Souko-san's face as she took the bottle.
#Akane
"So... that is the drink called 'cola'?"
#Souko
"Yeah. Want a sip?"
#Akane
"Oh, I'm still in the middle of serving... so, um, maybe just a little bit later..."
She seemed interested.
But I was impressed that she still put her work first.
I just hoped the carbonation wouldn't startle her.
#Rokuyou
"Cola, eh? I'm quite fond of it myself. I used to drink it all the time when I was in the States."
Rokuyou-san, who was sitting across from us, joined the conversation.
#Souko
"Really? Is the taste different over there?"
Souko-san was immediately intrigued.
#Rokuyou
"It's the same here as it is abroad—lots of different companies make cola. But the most popular brands taste pretty much the same everywhere."
#Souko
"Heeh... I see, I see..."
Souko-san was nodding with genuine fascination.
#Rokuyou
"Well, it's not like I'm the one importing it, so I don't know all the details."
Rokuyou-san laughed.
#Souko
"By the way, we haven't seen the bride yet."
#Protagonist
"Now that you mention it... she was the youngest sister, right?"
#Rokuyou
"Are you talking about Shion? Maya-san, how is Shion doing?"
Rokuyou-san spoke to Maya-san.
#Maya
"Shion said she wasn't feeling well, so she's resting in her room until the ceremony."
#Rokuyou
"I see."
#Protagonist
"Her name is Shion-san?"
#Rokuyou
"Yes. She's never been very strong physically, but she's a lovely girl."
#Souko
"Are you marrying into the family?"
#Rokuyou
"No, I will remain a Rokuyou. The Nanatsuki line is matrilineal, so I imagine they'll find a husband to take the name eventually."
#Souko
"Well, if it's about the inheritance, I suppose it would be the eldest daughter, Ai-san."
I stole a glance at Ai-san.
She was quietly eating her meal.
Perhaps sensing my gaze, she looked over at me and tilted her head curiously.
#Mikanagi
"I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Isamu was marrying Shion-san."
Mikanagi-sensei, who was sitting next to Rokuyou-san, joined in as well.
#Souko
"Oh? And why is that?"
#Mikanagi
"Because I was certain he and Ai-san would end up together."
#Rokuyou
"Give it a rest, Doctor. We've known each other since we were children, but we've never had that kind of relationship."
Rokuyou-san replied with a laugh.
#Protagonist
"Were you two close?"
#Rokuyou
"Well... we both shared a love for books, for one thing. And she was the closest to my age among the three sisters."
#Souko
"What about Benio-san?"
#Rokuyou
"Benio is... a peculiar girl."
Rokuyou-san gave a wry smile.
#Souko
"Ah... it did seem like she was putting on an act."
#Protagonist
"Was she really?"
I looked over at Benio-san in surprise.
She seemed to be eating quietly, but...
#Souko
"You didn't notice?"
#Protagonist
"Now that you mention it, she seemed much more relaxed when she was talking to Tsujimura-san, the manager."
#Souko
"Right? I'm betting that's her true self."
#Protagonist
"...Sorry, I didn't catch that at all."
#Souko
"You're so dense. I'm sure that foul-mouthed way she was talking to the driver when we first arrived is her real personality."
#Rokuyou
"She was probably just minding her manners in front of guests. She's much more casual normally."
#Protagonist
"Heeh..."
She looked so much like a refined Japanese doll that I'd assumed she was always quiet and demure.
#Souko
"We can't just talk all night, let's eat."
#Protagonist
"Y-yeah, you're right."
The plate in front of me was filled with sautéed chicken.
It gave off a subtle, mouth-watering aroma of garlic.
#Protagonist
"Wow, this is delicious."
The chicken was perfectly juicy without being too greasy.
#Mikanagi
"Narumi-san prepares all the meals here."
#Souko
"Yes, so we heard. Did she train somewhere?"
#Mikanagi
"It doesn't seem so. Her cooking skills are simply exceptional."
#Narumi
"That's mean, Mikanagi-sensei. What do you mean, my cooking skills *are* the only exceptional thing?"
Narumi-san, who had been serving nearby, came over to us.
#Mikanagi
"I don't think there's any need for you to start acting coy too."
Mikanagi-sensei teased her with a laugh.
#Narumi
"Oh? Benio-ojousama does it, so I thought I'd try it out too. Is it really that bad?"
#Mikanagi
"It doesn't suit you at all."
#Narumi
"My, what a cruel thing to say. Don't you agree?"
...Why did she have to drag me into this?
[Agree with Narumi-san]
[Agree with Mikanagi-sensei]
#Protagonist
"I don't think you should talk to a lady like that."
#Narumi
"See? Exactly."
#Mikanagi
"Haha, you've got me there."
#Souko
"He's at that age where he wants to look good in front of girls, you see."
#Protagonist
"What is that supposed to mean...?"
#Protagonist
"I think it's better to just be yourself."
#Narumi
"How mean! I'm always like this, aren't I?"
#Protagonist
"...I'm sorry. We've only just met, but I can tell that isn't the real you."
#Narumi
"...Tch."
She let out an incredibly loud click of her tongue...
#Akane
"Narumi-san! Stop chatting and go bring out the next course."
Akane-san appeared.
#Narumi
"Yeah, yeah, I'm going~."
#Akane
"Honestly, get your act together!"
Akane-san shooed Narumi-san back toward the kitchen.
#Protagonist
"It seems Akane-san is the one in charge."
#Rokuyou
"She's definitely the more reliable one."
Rokuyou-san said with a chuckle.
#Narumi
"Next is the lobster bisque."
Plates of a rich, red soup were set before us.
#Protagonist
"Is a lobster different from a spiny lobster?"
#Souko
"I believe they're more closely related to crayfish, aren't they?"
#Protagonist
"Heeh..."
Either way, they were high-end ingredients that I'd never get to eat otherwise.
#Protagonist
"Wow, this lobster is amazing."
The meat was firm and packed with flavor.
#Souko
"...There's no lobster in mine."
Souko-san muttered under her breath.
She spoke so quietly I was probably the only one who heard her.
She was stirring her soup with her spoon.
#Protagonist
"Ah... um..."
#Souko
"...It's a soup, after all. The lobster is just for the broth. It's perfectly normal for it not to be in there. It's not like I'm unlucky or anything."
I silently glanced at the others' soup.
Both Rokuyou-san and Mikanagi-sensei had what looked like chunks of lobster in theirs.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san... do you want some of mine?"
#Souko
"...I don't need your pity."
Souko-san muttered even more quietly than before.
