「Tsujimura-san, huh... It's true he's well-acquainted with the mansion, but even so... I don't see any reason for him to target Ai-san.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Benio
「...There's no reason for him to target my sister, but Tsujimura is about the only one who ever goes up to the attic. Though it's unthinkable, of course.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Tsujimura
「I was in the office, but... Lady Shion came out of her room around noon. I went to my own room briefly around 12:30, however...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「I wouldn't know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「If it's Tsujimura-san, I believe he was in the office.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「Tsujimura-san? Wouldn't he be in the office? He's usually there during the day.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
