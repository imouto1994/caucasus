"Excuse me."
Inside the room, Narumi-san was being treated by Dr. Mikanagi.
#Protagonist
"How is it, Dr. Mikanagi?"
#Mikanagi
"It seems to be a minor burn. The explosion happened inside the kitchen, didn't it?"
#Narumi
"Yeah... fire burst out from the gap in the door, and then... oh right, I felt a kind of numbing sensation when I touched the knob."
#Mikanagi
"Static electricity, maybe... I see, there might have been a gas leak."
#Protagonist
"A gas explosion... then."
#Narumi
"But I haven't done any cooking with fire today... and I'm sure I didn't forget to close the main valve."
#Protagonist
"...Which means someone might have intentionally filled the kitchen with gas."
#Narumi
"For what purpose... to kill me or someone else?"
Narumi-san said matter-of-factly.
#Protagonist
"...Is there a reason for you to be targeted?"
#Narumi
"I don't think there is, at least not for me... but since we don't know who the killer is, it’s possible I’ve been resented without even knowing it."
#Protagonist
"Is there anyone else besides you who enters the kitchen, Narumi-san?"
#Narumi
"Only Akane, besides me..."
#Protagonist
"Akane-san..."
Akane-san, who had suddenly vanished.
Where on earth could she have gone...?
#Mikanagi
"Well then—"
Dr. Mikanagi stood up.
#Mikanagi
"Please rest for a while."
#Narumi
"I know."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, I'll leave the rest to you."
Dr. Mikanagi left the room.
#Protagonist
"Um, I'm going to go check on the kitchen."
#Narumi
"Nnh, understood."
Narumi-san nodded.
#Protagonist
"See you later, then."
I left her room.
#Protagonist
"Narumi-san..."
#Narumi
"What?"
I gently pulled Narumi-san's body, as she looked up, into an embrace.
#Narumi
"Wait—!?"
#Protagonist
"Thank goodness... you're safe, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"W-What are you saying...?"
Narumi-san weakly moved her arms as if to pull away from me.
#Protagonist
"...Didn't the doctor tell you to rest?"
#Narumi
"And who is it that isn't letting me rest...?"
#Protagonist
"Well... that might be me, I suppose..."
#Narumi
"...Dummy."
Narumi-san's lips were pressed against mine.
