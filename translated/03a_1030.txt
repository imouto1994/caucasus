I came to Souko-san’s room.
I wanted to talk about what I'd found out so far.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, it's me."
#Souko
"What is it?"
Souko-san peered out.
#Protagonist
"I have something I want to talk about."
#Souko
"I see... come in."
Souko-san closed the door.
#Souko
"Did you find something out?"
#Protagonist
"Yes, well... I found out a few things... but they might not have much to do with the incident, you know?"
#Souko
"That's fine. Tell me anyway."
#Protagonist
"I asked Takamine-san about Mr. Kousei’s will, and there were some strange characters written in it."
#Souko
"Characters...?"
#Protagonist
"Yes... these."
I showed the copied characters to Souko-san.
#Souko
"What could it be... a code?"
#Protagonist
"Do you think so...?"
#Souko
"Yes... if these characters were just written there like that... it's natural to think of them as a code pointing to something."
#Protagonist
"What could they be pointing to...?"
#Souko
"Something Mr. Kousei was hiding but wanted to be found... or maybe a secret passed down through the heads of the Nanatsuki family."
#Protagonist
"A secret...?"
That word was what caught my interest.
#Souko
"I don't mean it in a lewd way. Successive heads of the Nanatsuki family were said to be eccentric, so it's likely they’d have a thing or two they’d want to keep hidden."
#Protagonist
"But the Nanatsuki family is a matriarchy, right? Wouldn't Mr. Kousei be an outsider, even if he was the head?"
#Souko
"Maybe it was because he was an outsider—that there was something he was told in secret."
#Protagonist
"...A secret of the Nanatsuki family..."
Shion-san didn't show any reaction when I showed her these characters.
That might just be because it was Shion-san... but maybe Maya-san would know.
But... I wasn't sure if I should ask her directly.
#Souko
"...It's worth looking into."
Souko-san muttered.
#Protagonist
"But Souko-san, I don't think this has anything to do with the incident."
#Souko
"Honestly, have you forgotten why we came here?"
#Protagonist
"I haven't forgotten. But... given the situation... shouldn't we solve the mystery first..."
#Souko
"...You're right. Sorry, maybe I'm starting to lose my composure a bit too."
With that, Souko-san turned her back to me.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"...Yeah, I'm okay. When I'm tired, I can't think straight."
With that, Souko-san picked up a cola bottle.
#Souko
"Do you want some too?"
She poured cola into a glass and offered it to me.
#Protagonist
"No, I'm fine... you're almost out of those, aren't you?"
The number of full cola bottles had decreased significantly.
#Souko
"Yeah... I wonder if they'll last until tomorrow."
Souko-san muttered, as if that was the most important thing.
I couldn't help but hug Souko-san.
#Souko
"Kya...!?"
#Protagonist
"I... I want to protect you, Souko-san."
I whispered in her ear.
#Souko
"...What are you talking about, you idiot?"
Even as she spoke, Souko-san relaxed her body and leaned against me.
