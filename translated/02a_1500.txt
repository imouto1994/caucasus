Narumi-san came to a halt in front of the kitchen.
＃Narumi
「The rest of you head to the dining hall. I’ll bring lunch out in a bit.」
＃Akane
「Understood.」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, I'll give you a hand.」
I stepped forward to join Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
「Hm...? Fine, whatever. Come help me, then.」
＃Protagonist
「Right.」
Narumi-san pushed open the door to the kitchen.
＃Narumi
「—Are you here to keep an eye on me?」
The moment we were alone, Narumi-san cut right to the point.
＃Protagonist
「Of course not.」
＃Narumi
「If you say so. You don't think I'm going to poison the food or something?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't think that at all. After all, if the food were poisoned, Narumi-san would be the very first person everyone suspected, wouldn't she?」
＃Narumi
「So you're saying I wouldn't be stupid enough to try it?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Narumi
「...Well, at least you seem to be thinking more rationally than that lawyer.」
Narumi-san let out a breath.
＃Protagonist
「Takamine-san? ...True, he did seem pretty hostile earlier...」
＃Narumi
「That man is all bark and no bite. ...Did you know? He even has photos of women displayed in his room.」
＃Protagonist
「Heeh...」
＃Narumi
「And they're dressed as maids, too. Ugh, gives me the creeps.」
Narumi-san shuddered.
＃Protagonist
「A-anyway, let's just get the food ready.」
＃Narumi
「Oh, right. Hang on a second.」
With that, Narumi-san headed over to the stove.
It looked like she was reheating some rice in a wok.
＃Protagonist
「By the way... you were already making this around noon, weren't you?」
＃Narumi
「Yeah, so?」
Narumi-san replied as she tossed the wok.
It looked like she was making fried rice.
The savory aroma wafted over to me.
＃Protagonist
「But you weren't in the kitchen the whole time, were you, Narumi-san?」
＃Narumi
「No. After everything that happened, I was in the Great Hall for a while, as you well know.」
It was already three o'clock, so she must have been away from the kitchen for at least two hours.
I couldn't quite remember if everyone had stayed in the hall the entire time or not...
＃Protagonist
「...I don't mean to be suspicious, but is there any chance someone else could have slipped in and poisoned the food while it was sitting here?」
Narumi-san’s hands went still.
＃Narumi
「N-no way... right?」
＃Protagonist
「...Right?」
＃Narumi
「...Wanna do a taste test?」
＃Protagonist
「No, no. The person who made it should be the one to try it first.」
I politely declined.
＃Narumi
「I already ate some when I first made it, so I'm sure it's fine. Yep.」
＃Protagonist
「But the taste might have changed after reheating it, right?」
＃Narumi
「...Fine! Let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.」
Narumi-san thrust her fist forward.
＃Protagonist
「Rock-paper-scissors...?」
＃Narumi
「Here we go! Rock, paper... scissors!」
Narumi-san threw her hand out.
[Rock]
[Paper]
[Scissors]
＃Narumi
「Shoot! ...Agggh!」
Narumi-san clutched her head and slumped down.
＃Protagonist
「Looks like I won.」
＃Narumi
「Dammit... fine, I'll eat it! I'll eat it...!」
Resigned to her fate, Narumi-san scooped up a spoonful of fried rice.
＃Narumi
「...If this is poisoned, I'm going to scream that you're the killer with my dying breath.」
＃Protagonist
「D-don't worry, it'll be fine...」
Narumi-san’s glare was terrifying...
＃Narumi
「Alright! ...*Chomp!*」
Narumi-san shoved the entire spoonful into her mouth.
＃Narumi
「Mmn... nnh, mmu... *gulp*.」
＃Protagonist
「W-well? How is it...?」
I asked tentatively.
＃Narumi
「...Yeah, it's perfect.」
＃Protagonist
「...And the poison?」
＃Narumi
「I don't think there is any. Probably.」
＃Protagonist
「Probably...?」
＃Narumi
「It doesn't taste weird or anything.」
＃Protagonist
「Well, that's a relief, I guess...」
＃Narumi
「Shoot! ...Hell yeah!」
Narumi-san pumped her fist in the air.
＃Protagonist
「...So I lost this time...」
My shoulders slumped in disappointment.
＃Narumi
「Alright, here. Open wide.」
Narumi-san scooped up a spoonful of fried rice and held it out to me.
It looked perfectly normal.
In fact, it looked delicious.
Even after being reheated, it didn't look dry at all; each grain was glistening.
I swallowed hard and steeled my resolve.
＃Protagonist
「...Here goes.」
I shoved the spoonful into my mouth all at once.
＃Protagonist
「Mmn... nnh.」
The savory scent of fried garlic tickled my nose.
I chewed a few times and swallowed.
＃Protagonist
「...Haaah.」
＃Narumi
「Well?」
＃Protagonist
「...It was delicious.」
Despite the tension of potentially being poisoned, I couldn't help but enjoy the flavor.
＃Narumi
「Thanks. ...But more importantly, what about the poison?」
＃Protagonist
「How should I know?」
＃Narumi
「Hmm... well, at least we know it's not a fast-acting poison.」
Narumi-san nodded.
＃Narumi
「Shoot! ...A tie, huh...」
＃Protagonist
「...Wanna go again?」
＃Narumi
「...No, let's just both eat at the same time.」
Narumi-san brought over two spoons.
＃Narumi
「Here, this one's yours.」
The small mound of fried rice was steaming.
It looked incredibly appetizing.
＃Narumi
「On the count of three.」
＃Protagonist
「...Understood.」
If it’s come to this, I might as well commit.
＃Narumi
「Here we go. One, two... three!」
I shoved the spoonful into my mouth all at once.
＃Protagonist
「Mmn... nnh.」
The savory scent of fried garlic tickled my nose.
I chewed a few times and swallowed.
...And then.
I noticed Narumi-san was watching me with a worried expression.
She was still holding her own spoonful of fried rice.
＃Narumi
「...Well?」
＃Protagonist
「What do you mean, 'well'?」
＃Narumi
「I just... couldn't quite steel my resolve.」
Narumi-san scratched her head.
＃Narumi
「But hey, you seem fine. So at least we know it's not a fast-acting poison.」
Narumi-san gave a satisfied nod.
＃Narumi
「Alright, can you start taking these plates out to the dining hall?」
＃Protagonist
「Understood. ...But Narumi-san.」
＃Narumi
「What?」
＃Protagonist
「...What if it’s a slow-acting, tasteless, odorless poison?」
＃Narumi
「Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We can just assume whoever refuses to eat is the killer, right?」
＃Protagonist
「I really don't think that's how it works.」
＃Narumi
「Just take 'em out already. And make sure you tell everyone we've already done a taste test, okay?」
＃Protagonist
「I know, I know.」
I grabbed several plates of fried rice and headed for the dining hall.
