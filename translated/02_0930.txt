We arrived at Rokuyou-san’s room, and I inserted the key I’d been entrusted with.
As I opened the door, Mikanagi-sensei rushed immediately to the bedside.
＃Mikanagi
「Isamu...!」
He stopped just before reaching the body.
＃Mikanagi
「...I see. Indeed, looking at this... it’s safer to assume he was murdered...」
Mikanagi-sensei muttered as he looked down at the headless corpse.
＃Protagonist
「Can you estimate the time of death and identify the cause?」
＃Souko
「Also, please tell us if the head was severed before or after death.」
Souko-san added, following my lead.
＃Mikanagi
「...Wait. At least let me pray for his soul for a moment.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, r-right. Sorry...」
Mikanagi-sensei knelt on the floor and offered a silent prayer to Rokuyou-san’s remains.
His best friend had been murdered, after all...
＃Mikanagi
「...I’ll examine him as best I can.」
His prayer finished, Mikanagi-sensei pulled out a thermometer and other tools.
＃Mikanagi
「This room is quite cold... while the body temperature would drop quickly regardless, it’s far lower than expected. It seems a considerable amount of time has passed.」
Mikanagi-sensei pressed against the surface of the corpse and peered at the severed section of the neck.
＃Mikanagi
「Rigor mortis is present, and there are no signs of livor mortis shifting. I’d say... roughly eight hours have passed.」
＃Protagonist
「Eight hours...」
I checked my watch.
Eight hours ago—around 2:00 AM.
＃Souko
「Right around the time the wedding ceremony ended, then.」
＃Mikanagi
「He was likely killed within an hour of returning to this room after parting ways with everyone.」
Mikanagi-sensei began to carefully examine the torn pillow.
＃Souko
「...Hey, around two o'clock was when you said you heard a noise, right?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I thought it came from downstairs, though...」
I looked up at the ceiling.
Directly above us was the room where I had been sleeping.
＃Mikanagi
「...I could investigate more thoroughly if the head were still here...」
Mikanagi-sensei muttered with a somber expression.
＃Protagonist
「No, thank you, Mikanagi-sensei.」
＃Mikanagi
「...Shouldn't we search the rest of the room as well?」
＃Souko
「...True. It’s possible some kind of clue was left behind.」
Souko-san gave my back a shove forward.
＃Protagonist
「I’m the one searching?」
＃Souko
「Didn't we just decide that? Do a thorough job.」
＃Protagonist
「...Understood. I'll give it a try.」
Now then—where should I look?
