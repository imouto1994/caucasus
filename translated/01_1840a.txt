＃Souko
「They're certainly a lively bunch, aren't they?」
Once we were back in the hall, Souko-san finally spoke up.
＃Ai
「Even so, they're both quite capable. Now then, let's head this way.」
Ai-san offered a small smile as she opened the door directly ahead.
Beyond it was a hallway similar to the ones we had seen so far.
＃Ai
「The north wing contains the guest rooms and the chapel. The door at the far end is the chapel, where the wedding is scheduled to take place tonight.」
＃Protagonist
「There's even a chapel here?」
＃Ai
「Yes. It seems the heads of the family have been Christians for generations.」
＃Souko
「Will our rooms be in this wing as well?」
＃Ai
「No, most of these are already occupied. ...Oh, that reminds me. I really should introduce you to Takamine-san.」
Ai-san gave a light knock on the first door to the right.
＃Ai
「Takamine-san, are you in?」
A few moments after Ai-san called out, the door creaked open.
＃???
「...Can I help you?」
The man who appeared was a large, imposing figure with a prominent scar on his face.
If I met someone like him on the street, I'd make a point of never making eye contact.
...In fact, I still couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye.
＃Ai
「These are our new guests. Since they'll be staying the night, I thought I'd introduce them.」
＃???
「I see.」
＃Souko
「I'm Souko Kirihara. I apologize for the intrusion, but we'll be staying here for the night.」
As expected of Souko-san, she didn't seem even slightly rattled by the man's intimidating presence.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, I'm (NAME01) (NAME02).」
＃???
「I'm Jin Takamine, the legal counsel for this family. Pleasure.」
＃Protagonist
「You're a lawyer?」
＃Takamine
「...Is there a problem?」
He fixed me with a piercing, icy glare that sent a shiver down my spine.
＃Protagonist
「N-no, nothing at all...」
＃Takamine
「Hmph... is that all then?」
＃Ai
「Yes, for now.」
＃Takamine
「...Very well. Until later.」
With a dull thud, the door was shut.
＃Protagonist
「Phew...」
＃Souko
「What an intense man.」
Souko-san voiced exactly what I was feeling.
＃Ai
「He can be a bit blunt, but he's not a bad person. Takamine-san's father was the family's lawyer before him.」
＃Souko
「That scar on his face... it looked like a burn.」
＃Ai
「Yes, he apparently suffered it a long time ago, but I don't know the details.」
Ai-san shook her head.
＃Ai
「Now... across from Takamine-san's room is Isamu-san—Rokuyou-san's room. Next to that is the room of Tsujimura-san, who handles the management of the estate.」
＃Souko
「There's an estate manager as well?」
＃Ai
「Ah, yes... Tsujimura-san is my uncle. He used to be a painter, but now he serves as a sort of butler for us.」
Ai-san knocked on the door a few times.
＃Ai
「Tsujimura-san, we have guests.」
We waited for a while, but there was no sign of anyone coming out.
＃Protagonist
「Is he not in?」
＃Ai
「Perhaps he's in the office...」
＃???
「Ai-ojousama, did you need something?」
A voice came from behind us, and we turned around.
A middle-aged man was standing by the large door at the end of the hall, looking at us.
＃Ai
「Tsujimura-san, were you in the chapel?」
＃???
「Yes, I was preparing for tonight's ceremony. ...And these are the guests who were stranded?」
the man called Tsujimura-san closed the heavy door and walked toward us.
＃???
「I'm Seiji Tsujimura, the manager of this estate.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm (NAME01) (NAME02).」
＃Souko
「I'm Souko Kirihara. Um, Tsujimura-san, are you the Madam's brother?」
＃Tsujimura
「No, I was the younger brother of the previous head. I used to paint, but I couldn't make a living at it... so I've been under the care of this house, I'm ashamed to say.」
With that, Tsujimura-san gave a deep bow.
＃Ai
「I happen to like your paintings, Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「No, no, you're too kind...」
Tsujimura-san seemed to shrink back, looking quite humbled.
＃Tsujimura
「I still have preparations to attend to, so if you'll excuse me.」
After another deep bow, Tsujimura-san disappeared back inside the chapel doors.
＃Protagonist
「He seems like a kind person.」
＃Ai
「Yes... normally he might have been the one to inherit the Nanatsuki family line, but he says he has no such desires.」
＃Souko
「Was that not mentioned in Kousei-shi's will?」
＃Ai
「That's... I'm sorry, I don't know the details.」
Ai-san became a bit evasive.
Well, it’s only natural that she wouldn't discuss the contents of a will with outsiders like us.
＃Ai
「Now then, I'll show you the second floor.」
We returned to the hall and began climbing the stairs.
Looking down from above, the sheer size of the hall was even more apparent.
