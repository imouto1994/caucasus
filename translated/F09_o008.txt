"It was sitting in the music room. It certainly looked like a vintage piece..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Maya
"That is something my husband purchased before the war. He reportedly had it imported all the way from Germany."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Ai
"I don't play... but Benio plays it often."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"Since it's German-made, the proper name is 'Klavier.' It's not a 'Piano.'"
＃Protagonist
"I-I see..."
＃Shion
"The piano... I know it's there, but I've never played it."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"...I'm embarrassed to say I used to dabble in it a bit myself. Since the Master was so busy, I was the one who taught Lady Benio."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I don't mind if you play it, but just don't break it."
＃Protagonist
"Y-Yeah..."
＃Mikanagi
"The piano, huh... It seems to be quite old. Apparently, it was one of Kousei-san's favorite instruments."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"The piano in the music room, right? I always make sure to polish it until it shines."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Narumi
"The piano in the music room? I've never seen anyone but Lady Benio playing it."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
