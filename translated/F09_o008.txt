"It was sitting in the music room. It certainly looked like a vintage piece..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Maya
"That is something my husband purchased before the war. He reportedly had it imported all the way from Germany."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"I don't play... but Benio plays it often."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"Since it's German-made, the proper name is 'Klavier.' It's not a 'Piano.'"
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Shion
"The piano... I know it's there, but I've never played it."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"...I'm embarrassed to say I used to dabble in it a bit myself. Since the Master was so busy, I was the one who taught Lady Benio."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I don't mind if you play it, but just don't break it."
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah..."
#Mikanagi
"The piano, huh... It seems to be quite old. Apparently, it was one of Kousei-san's favorite instruments."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"The piano in the music room, right? I always make sure to polish it until it shines."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"The piano in the music room? I've never seen anyone but Lady Benio playing it."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
