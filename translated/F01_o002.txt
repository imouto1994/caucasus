"A will, huh... I'm certainly curious about what he left behind..."
#Satoshi
"Me too..."
#Maya
"I'm sorry, but... the contents are not something to be discussed lightly with an outsider..."
#Satoshi
"Of course..."
#Ai
"The will? I don't know the specific details, but..."

"I see..."

#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"...Regarding that matter, there is nothing I can say from my position."
#Satoshi
"I understand..."
#Rokuyou
"The previous head's will? ...Well, I know the contents, but it doesn't really concern me."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"There's no way I could speak of it to an outsider like you."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Mikanagi
"That is... not a matter I am in a position to comment on."
#Satoshi
"I understand..."
#Akane
"The will...? I believe the lawyer, Mr. Takamine, might know something."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"A will, huh... I suppose it's about the distribution of the inheritance and such... but I don't know the fine details."
#Satoshi
"Of course."
