A grand painting is framed and on display.
I don't know the artist, but I bet it's expensive...
A painting is on display.
Several phone books are lined up.
There's one for the prefecture, and even one for Sendai City.
Phone books are placed here.
There's a notepad for jotting down messages.
It even has a pretty pattern on it.
A notepad is placed here.
There's a telephone that looks like it's from before the war.
It seems the culprit who killed Rokuyou-san cut the phone lines.
It's rough not being able to call for help...
There's a sofa here, so it seems you can talk while sitting down.
I don't have the peace of mind to relax right now.
I can't afford to be idle.
It’s pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
There are pencils for writing notes.
I wonder if Tsujimura-san was the one who kept them properly sharpened.
A pencil holder is placed here.
#Protagonist
"...It's a pencil."
#Akane
"I think anyone can see that..."
It's an ordinary pencil.
I'll take it just in case.
I now have the pencil that was here.
#Akane
"See, I knew it..."
Akane-san points to the notepad that was left there.
#Protagonist
"It's definitely the same pattern."
#Akane
"I don't recall seeing this notepad anywhere else, so I'm sure of it."
#Protagonist
"That means the only thing left is what was written on this paper..."
I stare intently at the stack of memo paper in the telephone room.
#Protagonist
"...It's no use, I can't tell."
Something is still missing.
#Akane
"Shall we investigate a bit more...?"
#Protagonist
"...Let's do that."
If there's something there, I should be able to find it...
If someone had written on this while the sheets were still stacked...
I took the pencil and began rubbing the surface of the remaining memo paper.
#Akane
"Ah... the characters are starting to appear."
#Protagonist
"I knew it..."
It's quite faint, but there's no doubt they are characters.
#Protagonist
"1140... Attic..."
That's all I can make out.
#Akane
"The attic...?"
#Protagonist
"Is there one?"
#Akane
"Yes... above the vaulted ceiling on the second floor, there's a machine room for the outdoor clock. I believe that's what it's referring to..."
#Protagonist
"Please show me the way, hurry—!"
#Akane
"Y-Yes!"
There's a high possibility Ai-san is there.
If it was the culprit who called her out—Ai-san is in danger...!
