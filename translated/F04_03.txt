I’ve arrived at the grand hall.
Naturally, it remains pitch black in here too.
#Akane
"Ah... are you alright?"
Akane-san, who had been gazing anxiously out the window, turned around.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san... what happened?"
#Akane
"I'm not entirely sure myself... is it a power outage...?"
#Protagonist
"It could be dangerous if something happens, so please try not to leave your room."
#Akane
"Yes... I suppose so."
Akane-san nodded.
#Protagonist
"I'm going to look around the interior a bit more."
#Akane
"Alright... please be careful."
Seen off by Akane-san, I left the hall.
I’ve returned to the grand hall.
Akane-san was still in the room.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san."
#Akane
"Yes, what is it?"
#Protagonist
"Has anything unusual happened?"
#Akane
"No, nothing in particular... no one else has come by..."
#Protagonist
"Perhaps everyone is staying cooped up in their rooms."
Well, that’s probably for the best safety-wise.
#Protagonist
"I'm going to look around the interior a bit more."
#Akane
"Yes... please be careful."
Seen off by Akane-san, I left the hall.
