"If you were looking into Nanatsuki Village, it's a story that would come up immediately. Although I couldn't find any literature that goes into detail."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Maya
"...I am aware that such rumors are circulating in the village. However, I do not know the details."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Ai
"...I do not wish to answer regarding that matter."
#Satoshi
"I see... I'm sorry."
#Benio
"The 'Curse of the Seven Possessed,' huh... well, fine. First, 'Item one: the case where the heads of the Nanatsuki family all die strange deaths.' 'Item two: the case where no males are born into the Nanatsuki family.'"
#Benio
"'Item three: the case of the disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Item four: the case of the mansion being painted pitch black.' 'Item five: the case of a massive flock of crows covering the mansion.'"
#Benio
"'Item six: the case of the "Sacrifice of the Seven Possessed."' 'Item seven: the case of the spirit of the girl used as a sacrifice wandering the mansion.' ...That is all."
#Satoshi
"Wow... thank you very much."
#Shion
"The Curse of the Seven Possessed... is it? ...I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"No, it's all right."
#Tsujimura
"I don't really know much about such things..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I have no interest in such nonsense."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Mikanagi
"A curse? ...Ah, it's probably just a rumor, right? I think Benio-san would know more about those kinds of stories."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"A-A curse, is it... I know there are all sorts of things being said... but it's scary, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Narumi
"A curse? It's true that they say all sorts of things in town... but if you want details, why don't you try asking Lady Benio?"
#Satoshi
"Good idea."
