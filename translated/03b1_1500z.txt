「I wonder if this is enough.」
＃Souko
「If you think it’s enough, then isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「It makes me anxious when you say it like that...」
Keep searching
It should be enough
I’ll search a little more.
I might have missed something.
＃Protagonist
「It should be enough.」
I wanted to let Benio-san rest as soon as possible.
＃Souko
「Right...」
＃Mikanagi
「Well then, let’s carry Benio-san to her room.」
Making a simple stretcher out of sheets, we placed Benio-san’s body upon it.
Dr. Mikanagi and I carried the stretcher together.
We laid Benio-san’s body onto the bed.
Benio-san’s black cat climbed onto the bed and curled up as if nestling against the body.
＃Protagonist
「...Come here.」
＃Protagonist
「...Benio-san is gone now.」
As if understanding my words, the black cat stood up and left the room with its tail drooping.
＃Souko
「...Let’s step out too.」
Stepping into the corridor, we locked the room.
＃Mikanagi
「I’ll entrust this key to Tsujimura-san.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... please do.」
＃Souko
「Let’s check in with everyone just in case. We might learn something.」
