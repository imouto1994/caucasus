Is this... an organ?
I don't really know the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it's obviously a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play it for a bit, but it's probably not good to touch it without permission.
It seems to be an organ.
Sheet music is lying on the desk.
It seems it was something Kousei-san was writing.
I don't really understand it, but perhaps it's something valuable.
The title is... "Three Pieces," maybe?
It seems to be a piece of music titled "Three Pieces."
It looks like sheet music is stored inside the glass cabinet.
Works by composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach, are lined up there.
Lots of sheet music is stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san likely used it.
I’ve already checked this spot; let's look elsewhere.
Sheet music is pinned to the wall.
It’s probably something Kousei-san composed.
Sheet music is pinned to the wall.
It’s pure white outside; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
A book is left lying on the music stand.
It makes it feel as if Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer, there was some blank staff paper.
A small piece of wood is placed on top as a paperweight.
What is this...? It looks like a fragment of marquetry.
＃Protagonist
「...I suppose I'll hold onto it for now.」
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It looks like a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.
