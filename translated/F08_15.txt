I've come to the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... I knock on the door, feeling a bit nervous.
＃Takamine
"Is it you... What do you want?"
＃Protagonist
"Um, have you seen Souko-san—I mean, Kirihara?"
＃Takamine
"Kirihara... Ah, her. She was in the grand hall, but..."
＃Protagonist
"When was that?"
＃Takamine
"...It was after six. She came into the grand hall while I was drinking coffee."
＃Protagonist
"Was there anything strange about her?"
＃Takamine
"...I couldn't really tell. We didn't really talk."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Can't you find her?"
＃Protagonist
"No... her room had been ransacked."
＃Takamine
"Ransacked...? Nothing like that has happened until now..."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... this feels different from before. Otherwise... there'd be no reason for Souko-san to be targeted."
＃Takamine
"Hmm... Hiyama-kun hasn't been found yet, either."
＃Protagonist
"Please let me know immediately if anything happens."
＃Takamine
"Yeah, understood."

＃Protagonist
"No, not yet..."

＃Protagonist
"Um, I'll be looking a bit more, so if anything happens..."
＃Takamine
"Yeah, I know."
