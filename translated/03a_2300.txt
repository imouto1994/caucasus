I left my room.
The light from the clinic was still visible; Dr. Mikanagi must still be awake.
I headed to the study next door.
There was no one inside the study.
Well, given the hour, that wasn't surprising...
＃Benio
「Kya—!?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...」
Benio-san was in the study.
＃Benio
「W-What... it's only you.」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san... what are you doing?」
＃Benio
「...I was feeling a bit restless. I thought reading a book might help me calm down...」
＃Protagonist
「I see... oh, right. Benio-san, about this...」
I showed the code to Benio-san.
＃Benio
「Symbols...? No, this last part looks like a proper word... I wonder what it means...」
＃Benio
「I've seen this before. If only we knew the meaning of that last word...」
＃Protagonist
「It's likely a language that Kousei-san was familiar with...」
＃Benio
「Father... right, it might be German.」
＃Protagonist
「German?」
＃Benio
「German and Italian are the languages most closely tied to music, and Father had many friends in German-speaking regions. Wait a second.」
With that, Benio-san began rummaging through the shelves in the library.
＃Benio
「I'm sure it was around here... ah, here it is. This one.」
She pulled out a small book bound in black leather.
＃Protagonist
「Is that a dictionary...?」
＃Benio
「A German-Japanese dictionary. We should be able to figure it out with this... It was 'KAMIN', right?」
Benio-san sat in a chair and flipped through the dictionary.
＃Benio
「K... K... Found it. This is it.」
＃Protagonist
「And the meaning...?」
＃Benio
「...It means 'fireplace'.」
＃Protagonist
「Fireplace...?」
True, every room in this mansion was equipped with a fireplace...
＃Protagonist
「What could that possibly mean...?」
＃Benio
「How should I know? I don't even know what this is. For that matter, why are you investigating something of Father's?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... it was written in his will.」
＃Benio
「In his will, hmm... Father must have wanted to convey something... but to use a code. It's as if he didn't want us to know about it.」
＃Protagonist
「I wonder... I was thinking it might be a hidden inheritance or something...」
＃Benio
「...Even if it is, it's not like whoever finds it gets to keep it all.」
＃Protagonist
「I know that.」
...Though I didn't know what Narumi-san was thinking.
＃Protagonist
「...Anyway, a fireplace. They're all over the place...」
＃Benio
「But that doesn't mean we can just go checking every single one of them, does it? Can you really investigate the fireplaces in everyone's private rooms?」
＃Protagonist
「...That would be difficult given the current situation...」
＃Benio
「As a member of this family, all I can tell you is not to do anything unnecessary.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
Benio-san put the dictionary back on the shelf.
＃Benio
「...Well, personally, I don't care if you do whatever you like. I doubt any hidden inheritance is actually going to turn up anyway.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Well then, goodnight.」
Benio-san left the study.
Now then... I think I'll do a little research here myself.
