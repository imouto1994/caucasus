I left my room.
The light from the clinic was still visible; Dr. Mikanagi must still be awake.
I headed to the study next door.
There was no one inside the study.
Well, given the hour, that wasn't surprising...
#Benio
"Kya—!?"
#Main Character
"Eh..."
Benio-san was in the study.
#Benio
"W-What... it's only you."
#Main Character
"Benio-san... what are you doing?"
#Benio
"...I was feeling a bit restless. I thought reading a book might help me calm down..."
#Main Character
"I see... oh, right. Benio-san, about this..."
I showed the code to Benio-san.
#Benio
"Symbols...? No, this last part looks like a proper word... I wonder what it means..."
#Benio
"I've seen this before. If only we knew the meaning of that last word..."
#Main Character
"It's likely a language that Kousei-san was familiar with..."
#Benio
"Father... right, it might be German."
#Main Character
"German?"
#Benio
"German and Italian are the languages most closely tied to music, and Father had many friends in German-speaking regions. Wait a second."
With that, Benio-san began rummaging through the shelves in the library.
#Benio
"I'm sure it was around here... ah, here it is. This one."
She pulled out a small book bound in black leather.
#Main Character
"Is that a dictionary...?"
#Benio
"A German-Japanese dictionary. We should be able to figure it out with this... It was 'KAMIN', right?"
Benio-san sat in a chair and flipped through the dictionary.
#Benio
"K... K... Found it. This is it."
#Main Character
"And the meaning...?"
#Benio
"...It means 'fireplace'."
#Main Character
"Fireplace...?"
True, every room in this mansion was equipped with a fireplace...
#Main Character
"What could that possibly mean...?"
#Benio
"How should I know? I don't even know what this is. For that matter, why are you investigating something of Father's?"
#Main Character
"Well... it was written in his will."
#Benio
"In his will, hmm... Father must have wanted to convey something... but to use a code. It's as if he didn't want us to know about it."
#Main Character
"I wonder... I was thinking it might be a hidden inheritance or something..."
#Benio
"...Even if it is, it's not like whoever finds it gets to keep it all."
#Main Character
"I know that."
...Though I didn't know what Narumi-san was thinking.
#Main Character
"...Anyway, a fireplace. They're all over the place..."
#Benio
"But that doesn't mean we can just go checking every single one of them, does it? Can you really investigate the fireplaces in everyone's private rooms?"
#Main Character
"...That would be difficult given the current situation..."
#Benio
"As a member of this family, all I can tell you is not to do anything unnecessary."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
Benio-san put the dictionary back on the shelf.
#Benio
"...Well, personally, I don't care if you do whatever you like. I doubt any hidden inheritance is actually going to turn up anyway."
#Main Character
"I see..."
#Benio
"Well then, goodnight."
Benio-san left the study.
Now then... I think I'll do a little research here myself.
