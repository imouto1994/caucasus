"Kousei-shi's old room, huh? I’m curious, but if it’s locked up tight, there’s not much we can do."
#Protagonist
"I suppose you're right."
#Maya
"That was my husband's room while he was alive. We’ve left it exactly as it was back then."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Ai
"That room belonged to my father. Even I have almost never set foot inside."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Benio
"Father's room is strictly off-limits. Even I’ve hardly ever been allowed in there."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That is the room the Master used to occupy, but it is kept locked now. I am the one in charge of the key."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Takamine
"Kousei-shi's room is sealed off from everyone. It’s a place that has nothing to do with you people."
#Protagonist
"Y-you're right..."
#御巫
"I don't know much about that room myself. It belonged to the previous head of the house, apparently... but I doubt you'll get a look inside."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"That room...? I’ve never been inside it myself, so..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I heard they’re preserving that room exactly as it was when the Master was alive... but I doubt there’s anything particularly unusual in there."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
