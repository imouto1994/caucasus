The world outside the window is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A bright red fire flickers within the hearth.

"Wait... this is impossible."
It's far too hot to investigate.

"I don't think this is the fireplace the code meant, anyway..."

"If we can't find anything elsewhere, let's come back and check it again later."

"I think that's for the best."
It's simply too hot to even attempt an investigation.
It's likely a cabinet for storing things like coffee cups.
I can't exactly go around opening things as I please, so I can't check the contents.
It appears to be a cupboard for cups and such.
A fine set of chairs and a table are laid out here.
I drank some tea here right after I arrived... I'm glad I didn't spill any.
It's a high-quality parlor set.
