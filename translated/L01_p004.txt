"...I don't see any reason for her to kill Rokuyou-san."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"Benio? I don't believe she was particularly close to Isamu-san..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"Benio killed Isamu-san...? No, that's impossible."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"I don't mind you suspecting me... but when I met you in the middle of the night, from my perspective, it looked as if you were coming from Rokuyou's room."
#Satoshi
"There's no way that's true..."
#Shion
"Is something wrong... with Lady Benio?"
#Satoshi
"No... nothing in particular..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Benio? She has a peculiar way of speaking, but she is not capable of doing anything wicked."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Benio-kun? I haven't really seen her speaking with Rokuyou-kun."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"Benio-san? ...She might have disliked Isamu. How should I put it... there are people you just don't click with, right?"
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Akane
"Lady Benio doesn't socialize deeply with anyone... so I doubt she had much contact with Master Rokuyou."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"Lady Benio? No strange behavior... well, she's a strange person to begin with."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
