"...I don't see any reason for her to kill Rokuyou-san."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Maya
"Benio? I don't believe she was particularly close to Isamu-san..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Ai
"Benio killed Isamu-san...? No, that's impossible."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"I don't mind you suspecting me... but when I met you in the middle of the night, from my perspective, it looked as if you were coming from Rokuyou's room."
＃Protagonist
"There's no way that's true..."
＃Shion
"Is something wrong... with Lady Benio?"
＃Protagonist
"No... nothing in particular..."
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Benio? She has a peculiar way of speaking, but she is not capable of doing anything wicked."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Benio-kun? I haven't really seen her speaking with Rokuyou-kun."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Mikanagi
"Benio-san? ...She might have disliked Isamu. How should I put it... there are people you just don't click with, right?"
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Akane
"Lady Benio doesn't socialize deeply with anyone... so I doubt she had much contact with Master Rokuyou."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"Lady Benio? No strange behavior... well, she's a strange person to begin with."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
