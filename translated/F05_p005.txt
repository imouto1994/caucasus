"...There's a very real possibility Shion-san will be targeted next. She needs to be careful..."
#Protagonist
"Right..."

#Ai
"I'm glad I was the one targeted... if it had been Shion..."
#Protagonist
"Ai-san..."

"I see..."

"I... don't really understand what's happening... I'm sorry..."
#Protagonist
"No..."
#Tsujimura
"...Lady Shion seems quite despondent..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."

#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Mikanagi
"Is it almost time for Shion-san's medicine...? I prepared it during the night, so it should be fine."
#Protagonist
"I see..."

#Protagonist
"I see."
#Narumi
"Lady Shion? Unless she's in her room, I've no idea where she is."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
