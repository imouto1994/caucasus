I leave the dining room and head to the north hallway on the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Takamine-san, it's me."
The door opens.
#Takamine
"Do you need something?"
A blunt Takamine-san appears, though he doesn't seem particularly grumpy.
#Satoshi
"I brought food. And…… can we talk for a bit?"
There's something I want to confirm.
#Takamine
"……I don't mind."
Takamine-san opens the door wide.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
Takamine-san's room is neatly organized.
A photo frame is placed on the shelf.
#Takamine
"Well, have a seat."
Takamine-san offers me a chair, so I sit down quietly.
#Takamine
"I believe I told you I didn't need any food."
#Satoshi
"But you won't last long if you don't eat, you know? I've performed a poison test, so it's fine."
#Takamine
"……Hmph."
Takamine-san reluctantly accepts the plate of fried rice.
He places the plate on the shelf and knocks over the photo frame.
#Takamine
"——So, what did you want to talk about?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, um…… I wanted to ask about Mr. Kousei's will……"
Takamine-san's gaze sharpens.
#Takamine
"……Do you think I can tell that to an outsider?"
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right, of course……"
I guess it's impossible after all……
#Takamine
"……However, given the situation."
#Satoshi
"Eh……?"
#Takamine
"You're looking for the culprit, aren't you? It might provide some sort of clue."
It seems Takamine-san is willing to cooperate.
#Satoshi
"Th-Thank you very much."
#Takamine
"Keep in mind, it's only what I can remember. Mainly the method of distributing the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"That's more than enough. ……I heard that even if Rokuyou-san married Shion-san, there would be no benefit."
#Takamine
"Ah…… that matter."
#Satoshi
"Is that because Shion-san is adopted?"
#Takamine
"I don't know what his personal motives were. However, the will stated that the inheritance was to be divided equally among Nanatsuki Maya, Nanatsuki Ai, and Nanatsuki Benio, one-third each."
#Satoshi
"If that's the case…… then Shion-san really wouldn't receive a single cent."
#Takamine
"If she had married Rokuyou-kun, she would have gained access to the Rokuyou family's assets. But even that is no longer possible."
#Satoshi
"Was this marriage proposed by Rokuyou-san?"
#Takamine
"That's what I heard. I don't know what his intentions were, but Maya-san was said to be delighted."
#Satoshi
"Was it just getting rid of a nuisance after all……?"
#Takamine
"……Perhaps."
Takamine-san lets out a long breath.
#Takamine
"That's about all I can tell you."
#Satoshi
"Thank you very much."
I wanted to ask more, but this seems like the right time to leave.
#Satoshi
"Well then, excuse me."
