「...It's just another guest room, so I don't think it'll matter... but here, it's open.」

＃Narumi
「Yes... though I doubt this is the place the code was referring to... Do you want to check it just in case?」
I’ve returned to this room.
＃Narumi
「Weren't we just here?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, yes...」
＃Narumi
「If you still want to investigate, then make it quick.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
