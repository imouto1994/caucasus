Small medicine vials are lined up.
With my knowledge, I have no idea what most of these drugs are.
I shouldn't mess with them, so I'll leave them be.
It's probably better not to touch anything.
There are things that look like medicine inside.
Some look like tree roots, perhaps used for herbal medicine.

There are things like disinfectants and bandages here.

Some documents are lying on the desk.
I probably shouldn't look at them without permission.
There are documents here.
Snow is dancing outside the window.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
There's another door, separate from the one I entered through.
It likely connects to the adjacent archives.
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
There's a simple cot here, completely different from the beds in the other rooms.
Well, it makes sense since this is the infirmary...
There's no sign of the bed being used.
Various documents are stored here.

In the bottom drawer, I found a pretty card.
#Protagonist
"What's this...?"
The card had the letter 'r' written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll hold onto it.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and solve the puzzle! This is what the answer section on the survey postcard was for!"
#Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I'm a little intrigued, so I'll keep this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"All the cards have been collected! Now for the question... if you rearrange the letters you've found, they form a certain word."
"Please provide the appropriate Japanese translation of that word for this work and send in your survey postcard!"
"Deadline is January 11, 2010, based on the postmark! 10 lucky winners will receive a small gift!"
#Protagonist
"...Phew."
I feel like I kind of get it, but also kind of don't...
There's nothing unusual inside.
