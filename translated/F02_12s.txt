The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.

「Hm...?」
A scrap of paper with something written on it is stuck to the toilet lid.
What could this be...?
『A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Three』
After the day's performance ended and I was taking a breather in the dressing room, that man from the stall showed up with a massive amount of takoyaki.
He answered bluntly that it was thanks for letting him do business there.
However, those obviously excessive takoyaki had already lost their heat, indicating all too clearly that they were leftovers.
I tried to refuse, but the man wouldn't listen, insisting that I didn't need to be modest.
To be honest, I didn't want them.
We went back and forth like that for a while, but I eventually gave in and accepted that forbidden item.
I just wanted to get it over with because I was exhausted after the performance. ~To be continued~

「...What the hell is this?」
A scrap of paper titled 'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Three' is lying here.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are kept.
It contains things like rags and buckets.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It's a perfectly ordinary mirror.
Naturally, it's very clean and not at all foggy.
A mirror hangs upon the wall.
When I turn the tap, ice-cold water comes out.
As expected, this might be a bit rough during this season.
The water has become very cold.
