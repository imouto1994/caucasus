「?It's been like that for a while now.」
Once the door was closed, Dr. Mikanagi began to talk.
＃Protagonist
「...You mean Akane-san, right?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yeah. ...Occasionally, she seems to be doing something in the study.」
＃Protagonist
「What is she doing?」
At my question, Dr. Mikanagi shook his head.
＃Mikanagi
「I don't know. I've never questioned her directly, and I don't think anyone else knows besides me.」
＃Protagonist
「...Does it have anything to do with this case, perhaps...?」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't think so. Her behavior has been going on since before this, and... I don't really think she's doing anything bad.」
＃Protagonist
「...? What do you mean?」
＃Mikanagi
「I haven't heard of anything going missing, either. I suspect she's researching something, but...」
＃Protagonist
「What on earth could she be...」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't know. I should have told her to stop before someone else found her, though...」
Dr. Mikanagi let out another sigh.
＃Protagonist
「...On the handkerchief Akane-san dropped earlier, there was 'Akari?M' embroidered on it.」
＃Mikanagi
「Akari...?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah. Akane-san said she made a mistake when she was doing the embroidery, but...」
＃Mikanagi
「...I suppose that sort of thing happens.」
Dr. Mikanagi murmured.
＃Protagonist
「I wonder...」
In any case, I might need to keep a close eye on Akane-san.
＃Protagonist
「Well then, I'll be going now.」
Thinking I'd head back to my room to gather my thoughts, I stood up.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, it'll be faster if you go this way.」
Saying so, Dr. Mikanagi pointed to the door near the window.
＃Mikanagi
「Your room is right next door, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
It's a door that connects the rooms directly.
It's certainly close, but...
I walked up to the door and twisted the knob.
It was locked.
＃Mikanagi
「The doors between rooms are special; this one can only be opened with your key.」
Dr. Mikanagi took out the key to his room and inserted it into the keyhole.
＃Mikanagi
「See, my key can't open it. Give yours a try.」
＃Protagonist
「Okay...」
I inserted the key to my room.
The door opened.
＃Mikanagi
「It can only be opened with a key from one side. So, I'm praying that you aren't the culprit.」
＃Protagonist
「...Of course I'm not.」
I can understand being wary of people who can open this door, so I gave a simple nod.
＃Protagonist
「Well then, good night.」
＃Mikanagi
「Yeah, good night.」
