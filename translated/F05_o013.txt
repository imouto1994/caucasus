「Shion-san won't receive any inheritance... then why did Rokuyou-san want to marry her? It's not like they were particularly close...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「...That is a private matter of this house, not something for our guests to hear.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yeah, you're right...」
＃Ai
「...I don't know much about the distribution of the estate. However, Father held many copyrights for his compositions and such...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「As for an inheritance... personal assets aside, the Nanatsuki estate is little more than this mansion and a family name. I have no need for such things.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「That's true...」
＃Tsujimura
「...Regarding that matter, there is nothing I can say.」
＃Protagonist
「That's true...」
＃Takamine
「All I can say is that Shion-kun will not receive any inheritance whatsoever.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「That is... not a matter I can say anything about.」
＃Protagonist
「That's true...」
＃Akane
「I'm sorry... I don't really know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「I've heard the Master's estate is quite substantial... even a third of it would be a staggering amount.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
