"Maya-san, huh... I don't see a motive for the crime at all. If you consider that she could get rid of Shion-san, her adopted daughter, the possibility is exactly zero."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Maya
"Last night? I returned to my room and went straight to sleep after the ceremony... Why do you ask?"
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Ai
"Mother? Last night, she returned to her room with us..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Benio
"I don't think Mother has any reason to kill Rokuyou. She values the family name far too much to do anything that would drag it through the mud."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Shion
"Is something wrong... with Mother?"
#Protagonist
"...No, it's nothing."
#Tsujimura
"The Mistress? She seemed quite pleased about the marriage, but..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Maya-san? It sounds nice to say she was happy for her daughter's departure, but in reality, it was just good riddance. It's hard to say."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Maya-san, right... There shouldn't have been any particular falling out between her and Isamu."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"The Mistress? She should have gone straight back to her room after the ceremony last night..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"The Mistress? I don't think anything happened between her and Rokuyou-san, but men and women being what they are... you never know."
#Protagonist
"I... I see."
