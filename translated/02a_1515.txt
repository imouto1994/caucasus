I arrived in front of the infirmary, knocked lightly on the door, and then opened it.
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me. I brought lunch.」
Dr. Mikanagi and Maya-san were in the infirmary.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, thank you.」
＃Maya
「...Thank you very much.」
＃Protagonist
「I'll leave them here.」
I placed the plates on Dr. Mikanagi's desk.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san is?」
I turned toward the bed?
＃Ai
「Um...」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
Ai-san had her eyes open and was looking up at me.
＃Protagonist
「Are you alright...?」
＃Ai
「Yes... thank you very much.」
Ai-san offered her thanks in a raspy voice.
＃Ai
「Um... you were the one who saved me, weren't you...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I was just lucky.」
I gently took Ai-san's timidly extended hand and returned it to her chest.
＃Mikanagi
「Her throat is quite sore, so it's best if she doesn't talk too much.」
＃Ai
「Okay...」
＃Protagonist
「Um, can you... eat some food?」
At my question, Ai-san shook her head.
She had been strangled by the neck, so it's only natural that she can't.
＃Protagonist
「Well then, I'll be going now.」
I wanted to ask Ai-san about what happened during the incident, but I held back and left the infirmary.
