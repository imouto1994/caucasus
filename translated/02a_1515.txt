I arrived in front of the infirmary, knocked lightly on the door, and then opened it.
#Satoshi
"Excuse me. I brought lunch."
Dr. Mikanagi and Maya-san were in the infirmary.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, thank you."
#Maya
"...Thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"I'll leave them here."
I placed the plates on Dr. Mikanagi's desk.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san is—"
I turned toward the bed—
#Ai
"Um..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
Ai-san had her eyes open and was looking up at me.
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
#Ai
"Yes... thank you very much."
Ai-san offered her thanks in a raspy voice.
#Ai
"Um... you were the one who saved me, weren't you...?"
#Satoshi
"...I was just lucky."
I gently took Ai-san's timidly extended hand and returned it to her chest.
#Mikanagi
"Her throat is quite sore, so it's best if she doesn't talk too much."
#Ai
"Okay..."
#Satoshi
"Um, can you... eat some food?"
At my question, Ai-san shook her head.
She had been strangled by the neck, so it's only natural that she can't.
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going now."
I wanted to ask Ai-san about what happened during the incident, but I held back and left the infirmary.
