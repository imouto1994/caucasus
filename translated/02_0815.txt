I ran into Tsujimura-san just as I reached the west corridor.
＃Protagonist
"Ah, Tsujimura-san."
＃Tsujimura
"Is something wrong?"
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san—Kirihara-senpai asked if you could bring the chapel key as well."
＃Tsujimura
"Ah—don't worry, I have it right here."
Tsujimura-san showed me his ring of keys.
＃Tsujimura
"I keep all the spare keys together."
＃Protagonist
"Oh, good. Let's get back, then."
＃Souko
"Tsujimura-san, let me see the chapel key."
Souko-san called out as we returned.
＃Tsujimura
"One moment, please."
Tsujimura-san began sorting through the bundle.
＃Tsujimura
"First, this is the key to Rokuyou-sama’s room."
I took the key from him.
＃Protagonist
"It's okay for me to open it, right?"
＃Benio
"We brought the key to open it, didn't we?"
＃Protagonist
"...Right."
I waited for Tsujimura-san to nod, then inserted the key into the lock.
＃Protagonist
"...Excuse me."
I slowly pushed the door open.
