Reaching the hall, I ran into Tsujimura-san, who had just come from the corridor on the opposite side.
#Main Character
"Ah, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
#Main Character
"Nothing, I just thought I should check to make sure everyone is safe..."
#Tsujimura
"...Has something occurred?"
#Main Character
"Yeah, well..."
I briefly told him about being locked in the basement.
#Tsujimura
"Good heavens... such a thing happened...?"
#Main Character
"Um, is Shion-san in her room?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes... she has not come out at all, however..."
#Main Character
"I see. Then I'll go upstairs and check on Maya-san and the others."
#Tsujimura
"I understand. I leave it in your hands."
I climbed the stairs.
To Maya-san's room at the very end of the corridor.
I knocked on the door.
#Main Character
"Maya-san, are you there?"
The door opened, and a weary-looking Maya-san peered out.
#Maya
"Is something the matter?"
#Main Character
"Has anything unusual happened?"
#Maya
"No, nothing in particular..."
#Main Character
"I see. I’m sorry to ask this, but would you mind staying in your room for a while?"
#Maya
"Yes... I don't mind..."
Though she looked suspicious, Maya-san returned to her room and closed the door.
Next was... Ai-san.
I reached Ai-san's room and knocked.
#Main Character
"Ai-san, are you there?"
#Ai
"Yes... what is it?"
Ai-san peered out.
#Main Character
"Has anything unusual happened?"
#Ai
"Unusual... no, nothing?"
#Main Character
"I see. That's good."
#Ai
"Did something happen?"
Ai-san tilted her head.
#Main Character
"No, it's nothing major."
I decided to keep the details hidden from Ai-san as well.
#Ai
"I see..."
#Main Character
"We still don't know what might happen, so please be careful and stay alert."
#Ai
"Yes, I understand."
Ai-san went back into her room.
Souko-san approached from the other end of the corridor.
#Souko
"How are things on this side?"
#Main Character
"No problems here."
#Souko
"Takamine-san was in his room too. Dr. Mikanagi... Akane-san went to check on him."
#Main Character
"It seems we can assume nothing has happened yet."
#Souko
"Right... though we can't let our guard down."
#Main Character
"Souko-san, could you stay in your room as well? I'll call you when the food is ready."
#Souko
"Sure, I understand. What about you?"
#Main Character
"I'm going back to the dining room. I need to talk to Akane-san too."
With that, I decided to head back down to the first floor.
