Reaching the hall, I ran into Tsujimura-san, who had just come from the corridor on the opposite side.
＃Protagonist
"Ah, Tsujimura-san."
＃Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Nothing, I just thought I should check to make sure everyone is safe..."
＃Tsujimura
"...Has something occurred?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, well..."
I briefly told him about being locked in the basement.
＃Tsujimura
"Good heavens... such a thing happened...?"
＃Protagonist
"Um, is Shion-san in her room?"
＃Tsujimura
"Yes... she has not come out at all, however..."
＃Protagonist
"I see. Then I'll go upstairs and check on Maya-san and the others."
＃Tsujimura
"I understand. I leave it in your hands."
I climbed the stairs.
To Maya-san's room at the very end of the corridor.
I knocked on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san, are you there?"
The door opened, and a weary-looking Maya-san peered out.
＃Maya
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Has anything unusual happened?"
＃Maya
"No, nothing in particular..."
＃Protagonist
"I see. I’m sorry to ask this, but would you mind staying in your room for a while?"
＃Maya
"Yes... I don't mind..."
Though she looked suspicious, Maya-san returned to her room and closed the door.
Next was... Ai-san.
I reached Ai-san's room and knocked.
＃Protagonist
"Ai-san, are you there?"
＃Ai
"Yes... what is it?"
Ai-san peered out.
＃Protagonist
"Has anything unusual happened?"
＃Ai
"Unusual... no, nothing?"
＃Protagonist
"I see. That's good."
＃Ai
"Did something happen?"
Ai-san tilted her head.
＃Protagonist
"No, it's nothing major."
I decided to keep the details hidden from Ai-san as well.
＃Ai
"I see..."
＃Protagonist
"We still don't know what might happen, so please be careful and stay alert."
＃Ai
"Yes, I understand."
Ai-san went back into her room.
Souko-san approached from the other end of the corridor.
＃Souko
"How are things on this side?"
＃Protagonist
"No problems here."
＃Souko
"Takamine-san was in his room too. Dr. Mikanagi... Akane-san went to check on him."
＃Protagonist
"It seems we can assume nothing has happened yet."
＃Souko
"Right... though we can't let our guard down."
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san, could you stay in your room as well? I'll call you when the food is ready."
＃Souko
"Sure, I understand. What about you?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm going back to the dining room. I need to talk to Akane-san too."
With that, I decided to head back down to the first floor.
