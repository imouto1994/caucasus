"Singing...? I haven't heard it, so I wouldn't know."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Maya
"Singing, you say... It's likely Shion singing."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"That must be Shion singing. She has a very beautiful voice."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"Singing... Isn't it Shion?"
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"I was indeed singing... Could you hear me...?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah... It was a beautiful singing voice."
#Shion
"Ah... Thank you very much..."
#Tsujimura
"That would likely be Lady Shion. She often sings to herself."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Singing, huh... I suppose someone must be."
#Satoshi
"Right."
#Mikanagi
"Singing... I'd guess it's Shion-san."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Singing, is it... Lady Shion seems to sing quite often..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"The one singing is probably Lady Shion. Lady Benio plays the piano sometimes, too."
#Satoshi
"I see."
