As I stepped out into the hallway, I happened to run into Benio-san.
＃Benio
「Hello there.」
＃Protagonist
「Hello.」
＃Benio
「You're quite the lady-killer, aren't you.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh?」
＃Benio
「You were walking Shion back, weren't you?」
＃Protagonist
「Were you watching...?」
I let out a sigh.
＃Protagonist
「It's not anything like that.」
＃Benio
「And what exactly is 'that'?」
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san just lost her husband?well, Rokuyou-san?didn't she?」
＃Benio
「The ceremony wasn't completed, so they never actually became husband and wife, did they?」
＃Benio
「...It's not as if they were in love, either.」
＃Protagonist
「But still...」
＃Benio
「?I suppose anyone would have sufficed, so long as they were the one to liberate her from that tower.」
Benio-san murmured to herself.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san??」
＃Benio
「Setting that aside, has my sister been found yet?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, no... not yet...」
＃Benio
「I see...」
＃Souko
「Oh, what are you two doing in a place like this?」
Souko-san came walking over from the direction of the hall.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san... Ai-san hasn't been found yet.」
＃Souko
「I see...」
＃Benio
「There's no point in just talking here. Let's head to the hall for now and figure out our next move.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
In the Great Hall were Maya-san and Dr. Mikanagi.
Maya-san looked terribly haggard.
＃Maya
「Um... has Ai... been found...?」
I silently shook my head.
＃Maya
「Is... that so...」
＃Mikanagi
「Let's go to the infirmary.」
At Dr. Mikanagi's urging, Maya-san stood up.
＃Maya
「Please... find Ai...」
After bowing to us, Maya-san left.
Tsujimura-san entered as she was leaving.
＃Tsujimura
「Where is the Madam...?」
＃Souko
「She doesn't seem to be feeling well.」
＃Tsujimura
「I see...」
Tsujimura-san was also lacking energy.
＃Tsujimura
「I've looked around the basement and other areas... but Miss Ai was nowhere to be found...」
＃Protagonist
「Is there anywhere we haven't looked yet?」
＃Tsujimura
「Even if you say that... I cannot enter the guests' rooms...」
＃Souko
「Is there a possibility she went outside?」
Tsujimura-san shook his head at Souko-san's question.
＃Tsujimura
「There were no footprints at the front entrance or the back door. Though, since it's still snowing, any footprints might have been erased as time passed.」
＃Protagonist
「The last time I saw Ai-san was just before eleven. That would be two hours ago now...」
＃Benio
「In two hours, unless it was a fierce blizzard like last night, footprints wouldn't completely disappear.」
＃Souko
「If that's the case, then she's almost certainly still inside the building...」
＃Protagonist
「But?」
And with that, I swallowed my words.
But?if she still hasn't turned up after all this searching.
＃Benio
「?Tsujimura.」
Benio-san spoke up.
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, what is it?」
＃Benio
「Did you check the attic?」
＃Tsujimura
「?!」
Tsujimura-san gasped.
＃Souko
「The attic?」
＃Benio
「Yes. Didn't the bell ring at midnight last night? There's a room where that machinery is kept.」
＃Souko
「You said it usually only rings at noon. ...I wonder if it rang earlier?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
Come to think of it... did I hear the sound of the bell?
＃Benio
「...I didn't really pay much attention to it.」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes... I'm ashamed to admit that I wasn't paying attention either.」
＃Protagonist
「...Let's go. Maybe?」
Ai-san might be there.
＃Souko
「...You're right. Tsujimura-san, please lead the way.」
＃Tsujimura
「Y-Yes... this way.」
Souko-san and I followed behind Tsujimura-san as we left the hall.
