The interior was incomparably warmer than the outside.
＃Benio
「Please, do make yourselves comfortable.」
As told, I took a seat opposite her, next to Souko-san.
The carriage swayed slightly as it began to move.
＃Benio
「Are you two a couple?」
＃Souko
「We're not.」
Souko-san denied it without a moment's hesitation.
Well, that's only natural, but still.
＃Souko
「He's just my assistant. Ah, I'm Souko Kirihara.」
＃Benio
「Kirihara-san. And you?」
＃Protagonist
「I'm Satoshi Kobayashi.」
＃Benio
「I see. And where did you walk from?」
＃Protagonist
「From the station at the foot of the mountain.」
＃Benio
「My... if you were coming from there, it would have been much faster to take a bus from the city.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so? I was told it was closer from the base.」
Of course, the one who told me that was Souko-san, who was now sitting silently beside me.
＃Benio
「Still, it's a wonder you made it this far. Summer is one thing, but people go missing in these mountains every winter.」
＃Souko
「See? My sense of direction wasn't wrong, was it?」
＃Protagonist
「Don't 'see' me.」
＃Benio
「Hehe... the two of you are very lucky.」
＃Protagonist
「You think so?」
＃Benio
「Yes. No one uses this path but us. Even then, only once every few days. I can only think of it as a stroke of incredible good fortune.」
＃Souko
「How much longer until we reach the mansion?」
＃Benio
「Let's see...」
Benio-san cast her gaze out the window.
＃Benio
「We're approaching a patch of snowdrops, so in this weather, perhaps another thirty minutes.」
＃Protagonist
「Snowdrops?」
＃Benio
「Yes, they're also known as 'Matsuyukisou.' They bloom around February or March.」
＃Protagonist
「Huh...」
So there are flowers that bloom in this kind of season.
＃Souko
「The language of flowers... hope and consolation, wasn't it?」
＃Benio
「Yes, you're quite well-informed. ...But are you aware there's another, hidden meaning?」
＃Protagonist
「A hidden meaning?」
＃Benio
「In certain parts of England, they are apparently treated as a symbol of death.」
＃Protagonist
「Even though they also mean hope?」
＃Benio
「Indeed. A flower that must never be given to another?for it carries the meaning of wishing for the recipient's death.」
＃Protagonist
「...That's a bit creepy.」
＃Souko
「It's not like the flower itself is poisonous, so it's fine.」
Just as Souko-san said that, the carriage stopped swaying.
＃Coachman
「Lady Benio, we have arrived.」
The coachman's voice drifted in from outside, muffled by the wind.
＃Benio
「I understand.」
She gave a short reply and then turned back toward us.
＃Benio
「From here, we must proceed on foot. Please bear with it for just a little longer.」
＃Protagonist
「Right.」
