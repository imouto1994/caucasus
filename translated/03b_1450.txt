"Whew..."
Emerging into the first-floor hall, I let out a long, heavy breath.
#Narumi
"That was a disaster, seriously..."
#Main Character
"In any case, we have to stop the culprit before they do anything else. Let’s patrol the mansion."
#Narumi
"Ah... h-hey..."
As I turned to begin my search from the nearest area, Narumi-san held me back.
#Main Character
"What is it?"
#Narumi
"Aren't you going to suspect me? I mean... I'm a thief, you know?"
#Main Character
"...You might be a thief, Narumi-san, but you aren't a murderer, are you? Besides, there’d be no point in you being locked in here with me."
If Narumi-san were the killer... she would have finished me off while we were trapped.
#Narumi
"I see..."
#Main Character
"Let's hurry, Narumi-san."
Stepping into the eastern corridor, we ran right into Akane-san as she emerged from her room.
#Main Character
"Ah, Akane-san..."
#Akane
"Is something the matter? You seem to be in a great hurry..."
#Main Character
"No, no particular reason..."
It was probably for the best not to mention being locked in the basement by someone.
#Main Character
"By the way... Akane-san, is your injury okay now?"
#Akane
"Ah, yes. I can't exactly afford to stay still at a time like this."
Saying so, Akane-san waved her still-bandaged hand.
#Akane
"Oh, that's right. Kirihara-sama was looking for you."
#Main Character
"Souko-san was?"
I wondered if she’d been worried since I’d disappeared from sight.
#Akane
"She’s still in the dining room..."
#Main Character
"Souko-san?"
Peering into the dining room, I saw Souko-san sitting in a chair, sipping a cola.
#Souko
"Ah, there you are. Where have you been?"
#Main Character
"Never mind 'where have I been.' It was a nightmare."
I briefly explained to Souko-san that we’d been trapped in the basement storage.
#Souko
"To think something like that happened..."
#Main Character
"The culprit might have been up to something while we were gone. I thought I should confirm everyone’s safety first..."
#Souko
"That’s a good idea. In that case, can you go check on the people on the second floor?"
#Akane
"Ah, I'll go check on Dr. Mikanagi."
Before we could say another word, Akane-san blurted that out and dashed from the dining room.
#Main Character
"...Then I’ll go check on Maya-san and the others."
#Souko
"Right, please do. I'll take a look around the first floor."
Souko-san placed her empty cola bottle on the table and stood up.
