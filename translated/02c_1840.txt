We went up to the second floor and stood before Ai-san's room.
#Benio
"Sister, it's me. Could you open up?"
Benio-san called out, but there was no response from inside.
#Benio
"……That's strange."
Benio-san reached for the doorknob.
#Benio
"It's open……?"
We stepped into Ai-san's room.
#Benio
"Sister……?"
#Satoshi
"Ai-san——"
She wasn't there.
I’d confirmed that she’d locked the door firmly earlier.
Did she leave, or——
#Satoshi
"……Let's look for her."
#Benio
"Of course."
Benio-san turned on her heel to leave the room, then stopped.
#Benio
"Love……?"
The black cat slipped between Benio-san's legs and ran into the room.
#Benio
"Where are you going? That's the bathroom——!?"
Benio-san froze.
Her gaze was fixed on the wall.
An electric cord extending from an outlet on the wall led toward the bathroom.
#Satoshi
"No way……!?"
We rushed to the bathroom, almost competing to get there first.
The sound of the bell on the black cat's collar echoed in the bathroom.
And then——
——Ai-san was there.
……Presumably, it was Ai-san.
A headless corpse was floating in the blood-red water of the bathtub.
The electric cord stretching from the room was submerged in the tub.
#Benio
"……Ridiculous."
Benio-san let out a breath.
#Satoshi
"How can this be……"
I reached my hand out toward Ai-san's body.
Benio-san grabbed my arm.
#Satoshi
"Benio-san……?"
#Benio
"……It's better not to move her."
She murmured with a stiff expression.
#Satoshi
"B-But…… like this……"
#Benio
"……We have to report this first. Moving my sister's body comes after the Doctor has examined her."
#Satoshi
"……Understood. But at least this……"
With trembling hands, I pulled the submerged electric cord out of the water.
Maybe this will——
#Benio
"……Let's go."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
We offered a silent prayer for Ai-san's body and left the room behind.
