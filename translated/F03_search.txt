An hour has passed since I started the patrol.
There didn't seem to be any particular problems, but...
I'm thirsty, so I'll go to the grand hall.
It's been quite a while since I started looking for Ai-san.
＃Akane
「She's nowhere to be found...」
＃Protagonist
「...Maybe we should have everyone gather together.」
I have to consider the worst-case scenario.
＃Akane
「Then, how about the grand hall at one o'clock? I will go and tell everyone.」
Saying that, Akane-san turned on her heel and left the room.
I'll head to the grand hall as well.
