I head outside through the back door of the office.
The snow is still falling as steadily as ever.
I hurry toward the tower, leaving fresh footprints on the narrow path.
I step inside and brush off the snow.
First, I have to confirm Shion-san's safety.
I head up the stairs.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san, it's me. Please open up.」
I call out and wait for a moment.
The door opens, and Shion-san timidly peeks her face out.
＃Shion
「Ah……」
＃Protagonist
「Thank goodness…… Shion-san, it must have been dark, right?」
＃Shion
「No…… it's always dim here anyway……」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so…… at any rate, I'm glad you're safe.」
＃Shion
「……I see.」
For some reason, Shion-san looks down as if dejected.
＃Protagonist
「Is something the matter……?」
＃Shion
「……No, it's nothing. Well then??」
Shion-san bows and closes the door.
I wanted to talk a little more, but…… it can't be helped, I'll head back to the manor.
