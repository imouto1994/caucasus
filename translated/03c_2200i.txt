I wonder if this is enough.
#Benio
"...We didn't really get any substantial testimony, did we?"
#Main Character
"No..."
#Benio
"Let's think about this a bit more... Come over here."
At Benio-san's beckoning, we moved from the main hall to the drawing room next door.
#Benio
"...In your opinion, who do you think is the culprit in this case?"
As soon as we entered the drawing room, Benio-san asked.
#Main Character
"In my opinion..."
#Benio
"So you think Kirihara-san is the killer... then who is that burned body?"
#Main Character
"It’s obvious, isn't it? It's Akane-san. No one else is missing."
#Benio
"True, that is a possibility... but isn't that a bit of a leap in logic?"
#Main Character
"...I don't know the reason, that's true. And Souko-san was in my room when Rokuyou-san was killed. But still..."
#Benio
"To make it clear, we'd have to prove that burned body is Akane, but..."
#Main Character
"Right now, the only clue we have to prove the identity is the broken bone..."
#Benio
"Something like that can be faked later as much as anyone wants... It can't be called definitive proof."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Benio
"Mother? ...But there's no reason for her to kill Kirihara-san, is there?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... I don't think there's **any reason to kill Souko-san**."
#Benio
"...So there's the possibility that the burned body isn't Kirihara-san."
#Main Character
"Akane-san is also missing. If the body is her, then another possibility arises."
#Benio
"Hmm..."
#Main Character
"Akane-san seemed to be looking into a lot of things. If that led to something disadvantageous for the Nanatsuki family..."
#Benio
"So Mother found out something and killed her to keep her quiet... That's not a very pleasant story."
#Main Character
"I suppose not... it's merely speculation."
#Benio
"Hmph..."
#Main Character
"...Do you know of an Akari Misono?"
#Benio
"Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was close to the doctor, so you should try asking him."
#Main Character
"...Why did she disappear?"
#Benio
"...Are you talking about the 'spiriting away'?"
#Main Character
"Is that not it?"
#Benio
"...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does that have anything to do with Akane?"
#Main Character
"...I heard she was Akane-san's older sister."
#Benio
"...I see..."
#Main Character
"Akane-san said she came here to track her sister down. She seems to have been doing a lot of investigating."
#Benio
"...Are you suggesting the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family?"
#Main Character
"I don't know that yet. However... I've heard that many people have gone missing over the years."
#Benio
"...That was before I was born. But still..."
#Main Character
"This is all just speculation based on the premise that it was Akane-san who was killed. It's just a possibility."
#Benio
"...I know."
#Benio
"...My sister is dead."
#Main Character
"That’s right..."
#Benio
"...And someone tried to kill my sister, too?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... but what if that was a fake?"
#Benio
"Don't be stupid. There's no way she could do something like that."
#Main Character
"There are ways to divert suspicion by making it look like you're being targeted first. If that were the case..."
#Benio
"...Even so, there's no reason to kill Kirihara-san."
#Main Character
"...No one has a reason to kill Souko-san. Except a cornered killer."
#Benio
"...Which means we have to find evidence that my sister killed Rokuyou."
#Main Character
"That might be difficult at this point..."
#Benio
"Me? To say such a thing, you must have clear evidence, right?"
#Main Character
"Eh... well..."
#Benio
"Go ahead and say it. I won't get mad."
#Main Character
"You're already mad, though..."
#Benio
"Shion...? Do you have proof?"
#Main Character
"Well..."
#Benio
"Don't treat her like a criminal without proof. It's offensive."
#Main Character
"I'm sorry..."
#Main Character
"It's not about Souko-san's murder, but regarding Rokuyou-san's murder... a snowdrop stamen was found in the chapel."
#Benio
"...You said one stamen was missing from the flower found near Rokuyou... but that doesn't immediately link back to a crime."
#Main Character
"However, it is proof that Rokuyou-san—or the killer—was in his room and the chapel that night."
#Benio
"...Continue."
#Main Character
"If Souko-san was killed because she was getting close to the truth, as we originally suspected... it's not an impossible story."
#Benio
"It's consistent... but right now, I have nothing to refute it with."
#Main Character
"...I don't think we need to fixate on this idea for now."
#Benio
"Tsujimura...? True, he's the one who can move most freely in the mansion... and he has the master keys."
#Main Character
"He could be a suspect. There's no clear evidence, though..."
#Benio
"It's a bit of a stretch to decide he's the killer based on that, isn't it?"
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Benio
"Don't say such stupid things. He died a long time ago."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Benio
"Takamine? I don't see a motive or anything, but..."
#Main Character
"It's true I can't find a reason to kill Souko-san..."
#Benio
"Then it’s better not to narrow your targets too much right now. Don't limit your perspective."
#Main Character
"I suppose so..."
#Benio
"If the doctor is the killer, that would be a disaster. Most of the findings would lose their credibility."
#Main Character
"That's the thing... I’d really like to avoid that..."
#Benio
"Besides, what would the doctor gain from killing Kirihara-san or Rokuyou?"
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Benio
"You should think about it some more."
#Main Character
"...Do you know of an Akari Misono?"
#Benio
"Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was certainly close with the doctor..."
#Main Character
"...Why did she disappear?"
#Benio
"...The 'spiriting away'?"
#Main Character
"Is that not it?"
#Benio
"...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does the doctor have something to do with it?"
#Main Character
"If the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family..."
#Benio
"...Revenge, then?"
#Main Character
"It's just a possibility. There's no proof."
#Benio
"...I know."
#Benio
"Akane is the killer... certainly, that seems the most plausible in the current situation, but..."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"...Do you know of an Akari Misono?"
#Benio
"Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was close to the doctor, so you should try asking him."
#Main Character
"...Why did she disappear?"
#Benio
"...Are you talking about the 'spiriting away'?"
#Main Character
"Is that not it?"
#Benio
"...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does that have anything to do with Akane?"
#Main Character
"...I heard she was Akane-san's older sister."
#Benio
"...I see..."
#Main Character
"Akane-san said she came here to track her sister down. She seems to have been doing a lot of investigating."
#Benio
"...Are you suggesting the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family?"
#Main Character
"I don't know that yet. However... I've heard that many people have gone missing over the years."
#Benio
"...That was before I was born. But still..."
#Main Character
"If Akane-san was investigating the Nanatsuki family, she might have seen Souko-san as an obstacle... It's not out of the question."
#Benio
"...I know."
#Benio
"Is there a reason for Narumi to kill Kirihara-san?"
#Main Character
"That's the thing... there isn't one..."
#Benio
"Please think more clearly."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
Benio-san let out a breath.
#Benio
"...Without clear evidence, no amount of thinking is going to matter."
#Main Character
"I suppose so..."
#Benio
"I'm going to think about this on my own for a bit. Not just about Kirihara-san, but going back further."
#Main Character
"Understood. I'll go back to my room and do the same."
#Benio
"Alright. I'll tell everyone to return to their rooms and stay quiet."
Benio-san left the drawing room.
I should head back to my room for now as well.
