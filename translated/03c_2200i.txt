I wonder if this is enough.
＃Benio
「...We didn't really get any substantial testimony, did we?」
＃Protagonist
「No...」
＃Benio
「Let's think about this a bit more... Come over here.」
At Benio-san's beckoning, we moved from the main hall to the drawing room next door.
＃Benio
「...In your opinion, who do you think is the culprit in this case?」
As soon as we entered the drawing room, Benio-san asked.
＃Protagonist
「In my opinion...」
＃Benio
「So you think Kirihara-san is the killer... then who is that burned body?」
＃Protagonist
「It’s obvious, isn't it? It's Akane-san. No one else is missing.」
＃Benio
「True, that is a possibility... but isn't that a bit of a leap in logic?」
＃Protagonist
「...I don't know the reason, that's true. And Souko-san was in my room when Rokuyou-san was killed. But still...」
＃Benio
「To make it clear, we'd have to prove that burned body is Akane, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Right now, the only clue we have to prove the identity is the broken bone...」
＃Benio
「Something like that can be faked later as much as anyone wants... It can't be called definitive proof.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「Mother? ...But there's no reason for her to kill Kirihara-san, is there?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I don't think there's **any reason to kill Souko-san**.」
＃Benio
「...So there's the possibility that the burned body isn't Kirihara-san.」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san is also missing. If the body is her, then another possibility arises.」
＃Benio
「Hmm...」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san seemed to be looking into a lot of things. If that led to something disadvantageous for the Nanatsuki family...」
＃Benio
「So Mother found out something and killed her to keep her quiet... That's not a very pleasant story.」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose not... it's merely speculation.」
＃Benio
「Hmph...」
＃Protagonist
「...Do you know of an Akari Misono?」
＃Benio
「Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was close to the doctor, so you should try asking him.」
＃Protagonist
「...Why did she disappear?」
＃Benio
「...Are you talking about the 'spiriting away'?」
＃Protagonist
「Is that not it?」
＃Benio
「...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does that have anything to do with Akane?」
＃Protagonist
「...I heard she was Akane-san's older sister.」
＃Benio
「...I see...」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san said she came here to track her sister down. She seems to have been doing a lot of investigating.」
＃Benio
「...Are you suggesting the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know that yet. However... I've heard that many people have gone missing over the years.」
＃Benio
「...That was before I was born. But still...」
＃Protagonist
「This is all just speculation based on the premise that it was Akane-san who was killed. It's just a possibility.」
＃Benio
「...I know.」
＃Benio
「...My sister is dead.」
＃Protagonist
「That’s right...」
＃Benio
「...And someone tried to kill my sister, too?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... but what if that was a fake?」
＃Benio
「Don't be stupid. There's no way she could do something like that.」
＃Protagonist
「There are ways to divert suspicion by making it look like you're being targeted first. If that were the case...」
＃Benio
「...Even so, there's no reason to kill Kirihara-san.」
＃Protagonist
「...No one has a reason to kill Souko-san. Except a cornered killer.」
＃Benio
「...Which means we have to find evidence that my sister killed Rokuyou.」
＃Protagonist
「That might be difficult at this point...」
＃Benio
「Me? To say such a thing, you must have clear evidence, right?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... well...」
＃Benio
「Go ahead and say it. I won't get mad.」
＃Protagonist
「You're already mad, though...」
＃Benio
「Shion...? Do you have proof?」
＃Protagonist
「Well...」
＃Benio
「Don't treat her like a criminal without proof. It's offensive.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm sorry...」
＃Protagonist
「It's not about Souko-san's murder, but regarding Rokuyou-san's murder... a snowdrop stamen was found in the chapel.」
＃Benio
「...You said one stamen was missing from the flower found near Rokuyou... but that doesn't immediately link back to a crime.」
＃Protagonist
「However, it is proof that Rokuyou-san—or the killer—was in his room and the chapel that night.」
＃Benio
「...Continue.」
＃Protagonist
「If Souko-san was killed because she was getting close to the truth, as we originally suspected... it's not an impossible story.」
＃Benio
「It's consistent... but right now, I have nothing to refute it with.」
＃Protagonist
「...I don't think we need to fixate on this idea for now.」
＃Benio
「Tsujimura...? True, he's the one who can move most freely in the mansion... and he has the master keys.」
＃Protagonist
「He could be a suspect. There's no clear evidence, though...」
＃Benio
「It's a bit of a stretch to decide he's the killer based on that, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「Don't say such stupid things. He died a long time ago.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「Takamine? I don't see a motive or anything, but...」
＃Protagonist
「It's true I can't find a reason to kill Souko-san...」
＃Benio
「Then it’s better not to narrow your targets too much right now. Don't limit your perspective.」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
＃Benio
「If the doctor is the killer, that would be a disaster. Most of the findings would lose their credibility.」
＃Protagonist
「That's the thing... I’d really like to avoid that...」
＃Benio
「Besides, what would the doctor gain from killing Kirihara-san or Rokuyou?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「You should think about it some more.」
＃Protagonist
「...Do you know of an Akari Misono?」
＃Benio
「Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was certainly close with the doctor...」
＃Protagonist
「...Why did she disappear?」
＃Benio
「...The 'spiriting away'?」
＃Protagonist
「Is that not it?」
＃Benio
「...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does the doctor have something to do with it?」
＃Protagonist
「If the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family...」
＃Benio
「...Revenge, then?」
＃Protagonist
「It's just a possibility. There's no proof.」
＃Benio
「...I know.」
＃Benio
「Akane is the killer... certainly, that seems the most plausible in the current situation, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Protagonist
「...Do you know of an Akari Misono?」
＃Benio
「Akari Misono...? She worked here a while back. She was close to the doctor, so you should try asking him.」
＃Protagonist
「...Why did she disappear?」
＃Benio
「...Are you talking about the 'spiriting away'?」
＃Protagonist
「Is that not it?」
＃Benio
「...I don't know. It’s true she vanished suddenly... but does that have anything to do with Akane?」
＃Protagonist
「...I heard she was Akane-san's older sister.」
＃Benio
「...I see...」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san said she came here to track her sister down. She seems to have been doing a lot of investigating.」
＃Benio
「...Are you suggesting the cause of the 'spiriting away' lies with the Nanatsuki family?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know that yet. However... I've heard that many people have gone missing over the years.」
＃Benio
「...That was before I was born. But still...」
＃Protagonist
「If Akane-san was investigating the Nanatsuki family, she might have seen Souko-san as an obstacle... It's not out of the question.」
＃Benio
「...I know.」
＃Benio
「Is there a reason for Narumi to kill Kirihara-san?」
＃Protagonist
「That's the thing... there isn't one...」
＃Benio
「Please think more clearly.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
Benio-san let out a breath.
＃Benio
「...Without clear evidence, no amount of thinking is going to matter.」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
＃Benio
「I'm going to think about this on my own for a bit. Not just about Kirihara-san, but going back further.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood. I'll go back to my room and do the same.」
＃Benio
「Alright. I'll tell everyone to return to their rooms and stay quiet.」
Benio-san left the drawing room.
I should head back to my room for now as well.
