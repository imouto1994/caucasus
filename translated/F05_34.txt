I exited through the door in the back of the office, walked through the garden where snow continued to fall, and approached the tower.
It's incredibly cold.
Maybe coming out in light clothing was a mistake after all.
The area around the tower door had been thoroughly cleared of snow.
But...

"...It's locked."
I can't tell if anyone is inside from out here.
It can't be helped; I'll head back.
Exiting from the back of the office, I shivered.
No, no, it was firmly locked earlier, so there's no point in going any further.
So, I immediately turned back inside.
