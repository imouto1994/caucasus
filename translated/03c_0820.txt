Now then... what should I do?
There was a knock on the door from outside.
#Main Character
"Yes...?"
I sat up and went to the door.
#Narumi
"It's Mizumori."
#Main Character
"Narumi-san...?"
I wonder what she wants.
#Main Character
"What's wrong?"
#Narumi
"Have you seen Akane?"
Narumi-san asked as soon as she entered the room.
#Main Character
"Akane-san?"
Now that she mentions it... I don't think I've seen her this morning.
#Narumi
"She's not in her room, so I'm looking for where she went..."
#Main Character
"But there are only so many places she can go in this mansion, right?"
#Narumi
"That's true..."
Narumi-san looked worried.
Well... given the situation, it’s only natural.
#Main Character
"Um, I'll help you look."
#Narumi
"Then could you go around and ask the others? I'll take a look at the other areas."
#Main Character
"Understood."
Narumi-san left.
Well, I’d better go around the mansion and search for Akane-san.
...I'll try not to think about the worst-case scenario.
