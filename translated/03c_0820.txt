Now then... what should I do?
There was a knock on the door from outside.
＃Protagonist
「Yes...?」
I sat up and went to the door.
＃Narumi
「It's Mizumori.」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san...?」
I wonder what she wants.
＃Protagonist
「What's wrong?」
＃Narumi
「Have you seen Akane?」
Narumi-san asked as soon as she entered the room.
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san?」
Now that she mentions it... I don't think I've seen her this morning.
＃Narumi
「She's not in her room, so I'm looking for where she went...」
＃Protagonist
「But there are only so many places she can go in this mansion, right?」
＃Narumi
「That's true...」
Narumi-san looked worried.
Well... given the situation, it’s only natural.
＃Protagonist
「Um, I'll help you look.」
＃Narumi
「Then could you go around and ask the others? I'll take a look at the other areas.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
Narumi-san left.
Well, I’d better go around the mansion and search for Akane-san.
...I'll try not to think about the worst-case scenario.
