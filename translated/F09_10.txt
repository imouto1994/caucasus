I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Akane-san pokes her head out.
＃Akane
"Ah, is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm just doing rounds of the mansion right now... Has anything unusual happened?"
＃Akane
"No, nothing in particular... Is there anything else?"
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Akane-san pokes her head out.
＃Akane
"Oh, what is it this time?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm still in the middle of doing rounds..."
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
She doesn't seem to be here.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
