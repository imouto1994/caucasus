「The possibility of Mikanagi-sensei... I can't say it's zero, but in that case, we'd have to doubt the autopsy results as well...」

「...True.」

＃Protagonist
「I see.」

「Last night I went to sleep immediately after speaking with you all.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「What... are you actually suspecting Mikanagi-sensei!? Mikanagi-sensei would never do such a thing!」
＃Protagonist
「I... I understand, please calm down...」
＃Narumi
「There was nothing strange about Mikanagi-sensei. He seemed like his usual self last night too.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
