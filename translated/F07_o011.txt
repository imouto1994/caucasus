"The phone lines were cut... What ever shall we do..."

"Yeah..."
＃Ai
"What should we do now..."
＃Protagonist
"Good question..."

＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
＃Shion
"The phone won't connect... I've never used it, so I don't really understand..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"If the phone lines were cut along with the suspension bridge... it would be difficult for an amateur to restore them..."
＃Protagonist

"The phone lines were cut at the suspension bridge. It was probably the same person."
＃Protagonist
"Right."
＃Mikanagi
"We can't even call the police if the phones don't work... It'll be a problem if anything else happens..."

"Yeah..."
＃Akane

＃Protagonist
"I don't know..."
＃Narumi
"...If they cut the phone lines, we can't report this to the police. We're completely isolated now."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
