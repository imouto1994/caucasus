An hour has passed since I started the patrol.
There didn't seem to be any particular problems, but...
I'm thirsty, so I'll go to the grand hall.
It's been quite a while since I started looking for Ai-san.
＃Akane
「She's nowhere to be found...」
＃Protagonist
「...Maybe we should have everyone gather together.」
I have to consider the worst-case scenario.
＃Akane
「Then, how about the grand hall at one o'clock? I will go and tell everyone.」
Saying that, Akane-san turned on her heel.
＃Protagonist
「A-Akane-san.」
＃Akane
「Yes? What is it?」
＃Protagonist
「...Please, be careful.」
＃Akane
「Yes. I know.」
Akane-san walks away.
...The culprit might be among the people she's going to talk to.
Should I go after her—?
Follow her
Don't follow her
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san—!」
I followed Akane-san toward the eastern corridor.
Akane-san was in the corridor by the dining hall.
Narumi-san is with her too.
＃Akane
「Did you call me?」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yeah... it's dangerous after all, so it's better not to act alone.」
＃Akane
「D-Do you think so...? But...」
＃Narumi
「I'm with her.」
Narumi-san came to the rescue.
＃Protagonist
「But... with just two women...」
＃Narumi
「...Sorry to break it to you, but I think I'm tougher than you are.」
＃Protagonist
「Ugh...」
I have no comeback to that.
＃Narumi
「So don't worry so much.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes... well, I'm counting on you then.」
＃Akane
「...Thank you for worrying about me.」
Akane-san bows deeply.
＃Protagonist
「N-No... well, see you later then.」
It should be fine if I leave it to those two.
I decided to head to the grand hall ahead of them.
...It'll probably be fine.
Even the culprit wouldn't just attack anyone they see alone indiscriminately.
...If that weren't the case, many more people would have been victims by now.
Despite a lingering unease in my chest, I decided to head to the grand hall.
