I was jolted awake by the sound of someone pounding on the door.
＃Protagonist
「...Yes?」
＃Narumi
「You awake?」
Narumi-san stepped into the room.
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, more or less.」
＃Narumi
「Good. We’re picking up where we left off yesterday at eight, so make sure you're there.」
Narumi-san was speaking in a remarkably casual tone.
＃Protagonist
「Right, I understand.」
I gave a nod.
＃Narumi
「Hey, are you actually awake?」
＃Protagonist
「I said I'm awake.」
My head was still a little foggy, though.
＃Narumi
「If you say so.」
＃Souko
「Good morning.」
Souko-san entered the room.
＃Narumi
「Ah, good morning.」
＃Souko
「It’s a hell of a blizzard out there this morning.」
＃Protagonist
「What—」
Startled, I looked out the window.
Everything was a sheet of white; I couldn't make out a thing.
＃Narumi
「It’s really coming down. The drifts behind the kitchen are so high we can’t even open the door to get out.」
＃Protagonist
「In that case, we might not be able to head back down the mountain today...」
＃Souko
「Probably not...」
Souko-san muttered gloomily.
＃Souko
「Anyway, quit lounging around in those blankets and get up.」
＃Protagonist
「I’m getting up, I’m getting up...」
I climbed out of bed.
Even with the fireplace going all night, the air outside the covers was biting.
＃Narumi
「Oh... I need to go wake Benio-ojousama too.」
Narumi-san spun around to leave.
＃Souko
「Is she still not up?」
＃Narumi
「She’s not a morning person. Plus, it was a late night for her.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah... that explains why she was in such a foul mood when I ran into her in the middle of the night.」
＃Narumi
「The middle of the night?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah. I think she was headed to the restroom.」
＃Souko
「Whatever. Let's go help wake her.」
For some reason, we ended up following Narumi-san.
