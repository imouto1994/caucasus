The fire in the hearth is flickering.
Thanks to that, the room is warm.
If it weren't for this... itÅfs a terrifying thought.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the hallway side.
I wonder if it connects to the room next door...
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
Everything outside the window is white.
I guess it's still blizzard-like out there this morning.
I couldn't even see the tower across from me.
It seems to still be a blizzard outside.
A painting is hanging on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
IÅfve already checked here, so let's look somewhere else.
This is the bed I slept in last night.
It was soft, and I slept very well.
The wedding ceremony continuation is starting soon, so maybe I should just wait in my room until then...
If you want to rest, I think it's fine to take a break...
There's an old, antique-style chest of drawers here.
It appears to be empty inside.
ItÅfs likely for guests; thereÅfs nothing inside.
This is my bag.
ItÅfs mostly packed with a change of clothes.
When I'm dragged along by Souko-san, I never know when I'll be able to go home, so I always bring extra.
Other than that, thereÅfs just my notebook and writing tools.
Oh right, I was going to fix the hardware on my bag.
I use the pliers I borrowed from the storage room to lightly crush the bag's clasp.
The pliers seem to be quite worn out, as if theyÅfre about to break any minute.

ÅuAh...Åv
A small knife tumbled out of my bag's pocket.
Oh yeah, I did put that in here...
I don't have any particular use for it, but I'll hold onto it for now.
I don't need anything from it right now.
