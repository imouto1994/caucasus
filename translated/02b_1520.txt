Now I have to deliver food to Shion-san as well.
I pass through the office and head outside.
The snow is still falling as steadily as ever.
The door was unlocked.
Hoping to get the fried rice to her before it gets cold, I hurry up the stairs.
In front of the door to Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me. I've brought lunch."
Shion-san peeks her face out.
#Shion
"Ah…… thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going."
#Shion
"A-Ah, um……!"
#Satoshi
"Yes?"
#Shion
"Well…… p-please be careful……"
#Satoshi
"Yeah, I know."
After answering Shion-san, I decide to head back to the dining room.
