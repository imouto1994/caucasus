While I was dozing off, there was a knock at the door.
＃Narumi
「Excuse me. The preparations for the ceremony are complete, so I've come to guide you.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, right. ...But are you sure I'm okay in these clothes?」
I asked Narumi-san while gesturing to my outfit.
＃Narumi
「...Why not? It's not like you're the groom or the guest of honor.」
I was given a very dismissive answer.
＃Narumi
「Come on, hurry up. We're going to be late.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, right...」
I was practically shooed out of the room by Narumi-san.
