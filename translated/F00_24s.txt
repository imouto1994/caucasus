This is likely the extent of what can be investigated in this room.
I open the top lid and peer inside, but there's nothing of note.
If there were a key in a place like this, it would probably throw off the piano's sound...
I don't see anything that looks like a key.
I stare at the piano keys.
No particularly strange sounds come out.

"...The keyhole in the fireplace was small, wasn't it?"
＃Narumi
"Well, yes..."
＃Protagonist
"...Doesn't it look like a key could fit inside one of these piano keys?"
＃Narumi
"Inside the keys...?"
＃Protagonist
"I think if we hollowed out one of the white keys, it might just work..."
＃Narumi
"If you have a reason for it, I suppose it's worth checking..."
＃Protagonist
"If '1SO' refers to the music room... then I think 'K' stands for the piano, and 'H5' might be the key itself."
＃Narumi
"...I believe the German word for piano was 'Klavier,' wasn't it?"
＃Protagonist
"Now all that's left is the location of 'H5'..."
＃Narumi
"You can't just go tearing the whole thing apart, you know?"
＃Protagonist
"I know. Let's do this carefully."
Outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
I’ve searched all over, but I can't find anything that looks like a key.
