I’ve arrived at the reception room.
＃Shion
「Ah...」
Shion-san was there.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san, how are you feeling?」
＃Shion
「Still... not very well...」
＃Protagonist
「Don't you think it's better if you rest in your room?」
＃Shion
「Yes... perhaps. But... it's always like this...」
Shion-san gave a weak smile.
＃Protagonist
「...Please don't push yourself.」
＃Shion
「Yes, thank you. By the way... did you have business with me?」
Shion-san was still in the reception room.
＃Shion
「Ah... what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「I’m just doing my rounds. I don't know what might happen yet, after all.」
＃Shion
「Will... something else happen...?」
＃Protagonist
「I can't say for sure... but I intend to do my best to ensure nothing does.」
＃Shion
「I see...」
Shion-san looks exhausted as well.
＃Shion
「...Did you need anything else...?」
