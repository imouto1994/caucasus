I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
＃Ai
「Oh... is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, have you seen Souko-san?」
＃Ai
「Mistress Kirihara...? No, I've been in my room the whole time, so I wouldn't know...」
＃Protagonist
「I see... Thank you very much.」
I thanked her and left.
I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
＃Ai
「Oh... have you still not found Mistress Kirihara?」
＃Protagonist
「No... she's nowhere to be found.」
＃Ai
「I see...」
Ai-san's expression clouds over.
＃Protagonist
「Um, if anything happens, please let me know immediately.」
＃Ai
「Yes, understood.」
I decided to go somewhere else.
I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
Ai-san's body is laid to rest here.
I pull back my hand from the doorknob and decide to go somewhere else.
