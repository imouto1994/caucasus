Now then... what should I do?
There was a knock on the door from outside.
＃Protagonist
「Yes...?」
I sat up and went to the door.
＃Akane
「Um, it's Hiyama.」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san...?」
I wonder what she wants.
＃Akane
「Um... do you have a moment?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, I don't mind... but what's wrong?」
She looked troubled.
＃Akane
「Well... about last night.」
＃Protagonist
「Last night? ...Ah.」
About her being in Mr. Kousei's study.
＃Akane
「Um... may I come in?」
＃Protagonist
「...Yes, please do.」
I let Akane-san into the room and closed the door.
She probably doesn't want anyone to overhear.
＃Protagonist
「...Something about last night?」
＃Akane
「Yes... um, did you tell anyone about it...?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... I spoke with Dr. Mikanagi for a bit right after that.」
＃Akane
「Eh...」
The color drained from Akane-san's face.
＃Protagonist
「Dr. Mikanagi said he didn't think you were doing anything wrong, though... Akane-san?」
＃Akane
「Ah, no, um... did he say anything else...?」
＃Protagonist
「...No, not really.」
＃Akane
「...I see.」
Was that a sigh of relief, or disappointment?
She let out a very subtle sigh.
＃Akane
「Then... um, please keep what happened last night a secret.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, I understand.」
＃Akane
「Well then... excuse me.」
Akane-san left the room.
I don't know what she's trying to do, but I get the feeling it's at least not related to the current incident.
If it is related... well, I'll deal with it then.
＃Protagonist
「That handkerchief... it was embroidered with 'Akari?M', wasn't it?」
＃Akane
「Ah, that...」
＃Protagonist
「Could it be... Akari Misono-san?」
＃Akane
「?!? H-How...」
＃Protagonist
「...I heard it from Dr. Mikanagi. He said she was someone precious to him.」
＃Akane
「Someone precious...」
＃Protagonist
「...I think they might have been lovers.」
＃Akane
「...I see.」
＃Protagonist
「Um... Akane-san...?」
＃Akane
「...Akari Misono is my older sister.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...」
＃Akane
「She worked here at the Nanatsuki mansion. But... after some time, I suddenly stopped hearing from her.」
＃Protagonist
「...There was no contact at all?」
Akane-san shook her head at my question.
＃Akane
「...None. That's why I had to find out... I took my mother's surname and started working here.」
＃Protagonist
「...Dr. Mikanagi said something similar.」
＃Akane
「I see...」
There were tears in Akane-san's voice.
＃Akane
「I've been looking for clues ever since I got here, but... I haven't found anything...」
＃Protagonist
「...Have you talked to anyone else about it?」
＃Akane
「...I couldn't. Because... I didn't know why she disappeared...」
＃Protagonist
「...You thought someone might have done something to her. ...Just like this time.」
It was a vague way of putting it, but Akane-san nodded.
＃Akane
「Everything I've heard is nothing more than rumors... I don't know what to do now...」
Akane-san covered her face with both hands.
＃Protagonist
「...You can't give up.」
The words were out of my mouth before I could think.
＃Akane
「Eh...?」
She looked up, her face wet with tears.
＃Protagonist
「I don't think you should give up. If there's something in this house... let's find out, together.」
＃Akane
「I-I'm...」
Akane-san started to cry and hugged me.
＃Akane
「I had... no one to turn to... it was so hard...」
＃Protagonist
「...It's all right now.」
I stroked Akane-san's hair for a while, comforting her.
＃Akane
「Ah...」
Perhaps realizing her current situation, Akane-san suddenly pulled away from me.
＃Akane
「I-I'm sorry...」
＃Protagonist
「No... are you all right now?」
＃Akane
「Y-Yes, I'm fine now! Thank you so much for listening to me!」
Akane-san bowed her head vigorously.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, no, the pleasure is mine.」
＃Akane
「Well then, I'll get back to work.」
With the pitter-patter of footsteps, Akane-san left the room.
＃Akane
「U-Um...」
Akane-san let out a small voice in my arms.
＃Protagonist
「Yes... ah, sorry...」
In the heat of the moment, I'd ended up holding her tight.
Embarrassed, I tried to pull away immediately, but Akane-san's hands held me back.
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Akane-san...?」
＃Akane
「P-Please... just a little longer.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes...」
And so, I continued to hold Akane-san.
When I did... I suddenly became very aware of her.
The softness of her body, the faint, sweet scent...
＃Protagonist
「...A-Akane-san...」
Her thigh was pressing against my crotch.
Faced with such stimulation, and being a young man, the blood naturally started to pool.
＃Akane
「...It's okay.」
As if seeing right into my heart, Akane-san whispered in my ear.
＃Akane
「If you don't mind a woman as tainted as me...」
＃Protagonist
「...You aren't tainted, Akane-san.」
I pulled her body close and held her tight.
＃Akane
「...Thank you very much.」
