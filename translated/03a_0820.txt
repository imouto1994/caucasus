Now then... what should I do?
There was a knock on the door from outside.
#Main Character
"Yes...?"
I sat up and went to the door.
#Akane
"Um, it's Hiyama."
#Main Character
"Akane-san...?"
I wonder what she wants.
#Akane
"Um... do you have a moment?"
#Main Character
"Yes, I don't mind... but what's wrong?"
She looked troubled.
#Akane
"Well... about last night."
#Main Character
"Last night? ...Ah."
About her being in Mr. Kousei's study.
#Akane
"Um... may I come in?"
#Main Character
"...Yes, please do."
I let Akane-san into the room and closed the door.
She probably doesn't want anyone to overhear.
#Main Character
"...Something about last night?"
#Akane
"Yes... um, did you tell anyone about it...?"
#Main Character
"Well... I spoke with Dr. Mikanagi for a bit right after that."
#Akane
"Eh..."
The color drained from Akane-san's face.
#Main Character
"Dr. Mikanagi said he didn't think you were doing anything wrong, though... Akane-san?"
#Akane
"Ah, no, um... did he say anything else...?"
#Main Character
"...No, not really."
#Akane
"...I see."
Was that a sigh of relief, or disappointment?
She let out a very subtle sigh.
#Akane
"Then... um, please keep what happened last night a secret."
#Main Character
"Yes, I understand."
#Akane
"Well then... excuse me."
Akane-san left the room.
I don't know what she's trying to do, but I get the feeling it's at least not related to the current incident.
If it is related... well, I'll deal with it then.
#Main Character
"That handkerchief... it was embroidered with 'Akari·M', wasn't it?"
#Akane
"Ah, that..."
#Main Character
"Could it be... Akari Misono-san?"
#Akane
"—!? H-How..."
#Main Character
"...I heard it from Dr. Mikanagi. He said she was someone precious to him."
#Akane
"Someone precious..."
#Main Character
"...I think they might have been lovers."
#Akane
"...I see."
#Main Character
"Um... Akane-san...?"
#Akane
"...Akari Misono is my older sister."
#Main Character
"Eh..."
#Akane
"She worked here at the Nanatsuki mansion. But... after some time, I suddenly stopped hearing from her."
#Main Character
"...There was no contact at all?"
Akane-san shook her head at my question.
#Akane
"...None. That's why I had to find out... I took my mother's surname and started working here."
#Main Character
"...Dr. Mikanagi said something similar."
#Akane
"I see..."
There were tears in Akane-san's voice.
#Akane
"I've been looking for clues ever since I got here, but... I haven't found anything..."
#Main Character
"...Have you talked to anyone else about it?"
#Akane
"...I couldn't. Because... I didn't know why she disappeared..."
#Main Character
"...You thought someone might have done something to her. ...Just like this time."
It was a vague way of putting it, but Akane-san nodded.
#Akane
"Everything I've heard is nothing more than rumors... I don't know what to do now..."
Akane-san covered her face with both hands.
#Main Character
"...You can't give up."
The words were out of my mouth before I could think.
#Akane
"Eh...?"
She looked up, her face wet with tears.
#Main Character
"I don't think you should give up. If there's something in this house... let's find out, together."
#Akane
"I-I'm..."
Akane-san started to cry and hugged me.
#Akane
"I had... no one to turn to... it was so hard..."
#Main Character
"...It's all right now."
I stroked Akane-san's hair for a while, comforting her.
#Akane
"Ah..."
Perhaps realizing her current situation, Akane-san suddenly pulled away from me.
#Akane
"I-I'm sorry..."
#Main Character
"No... are you all right now?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes, I'm fine now! Thank you so much for listening to me!"
Akane-san bowed her head vigorously.
#Main Character
"Ah, no, the pleasure is mine."
#Akane
"Well then, I'll get back to work."
With the pitter-patter of footsteps, Akane-san left the room.
#Akane
"U-Um..."
Akane-san let out a small voice in my arms.
#Main Character
"Yes... ah, sorry..."
In the heat of the moment, I'd ended up holding her tight.
Embarrassed, I tried to pull away immediately, but Akane-san's hands held me back.
#Main Character
"Eh... Akane-san...?"
#Akane
"P-Please... just a little longer."
#Main Character
"Y-Yes..."
And so, I continued to hold Akane-san.
When I did... I suddenly became very aware of her.
The softness of her body, the faint, sweet scent...
#Main Character
"...A-Akane-san..."
Her thigh was pressing against my crotch.
Faced with such stimulation, and being a young man, the blood naturally started to pool.
#Akane
"...It's okay."
As if seeing right into my heart, Akane-san whispered in my ear.
#Akane
"If you don't mind a woman as tainted as me..."
#Main Character
"...You aren't tainted, Akane-san."
I pulled her body close and held her tight.
#Akane
"...Thank you very much."
