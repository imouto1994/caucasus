＃Souko
"...She seems quite shaken up."
＃Protagonist
"...You're right."
＃Souko
"...I still can't grasp the culprit's intent. Why would they kill Ai-san...?"
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Maya
"I'm glad Ai was safe, but... why did something like this happen...?"
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Maya
"Why Ai too...? Are you saying that child did something wrong...?"
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san..."
＃Ai
"...I couldn't sleep well last night. I felt like I might be attacked again..."
＃Protagonist
"Ai-san..."
＃Benio
"I have a feeling that attack on my sister was carried out differently than the one on Rokuyou..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"...I don't think it will end with my sister being killed. Next will be me... or someone else."
＃Protagonist
"That might be true..."
＃Shion
"...Why Sister Ai... just who would..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Ai seems quite shaken. I suppose it's only natural after something like that..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Tsujimura
"...Why did Lady Ai have to be killed...?"
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Takamine
"...In any case, I'm glad Ai-kun didn't lose her life."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Takamine
"...Even Ai-kun was killed, but nothing happened last night... I wonder if it’s finally over..."
＃Protagonist
"Who knows..."
＃Mikanagi
"As for Ai-san, I expect she's returned to her room. After what happened yesterday, it's better if she rests."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Mikanagi
"What is the culprit's aim...? What do they gain by killing Isamu and Ai-san...?"
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Akane
"Lady Ai? She's in her room. She still doesn't seem to be feeling very well."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Akane
"Why Lady Ai...? She hasn't done anything wrong..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Narumi
"Lady Ai? She's likely in her room."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"...If even Lady Ai was killed, it might not be over yet..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
