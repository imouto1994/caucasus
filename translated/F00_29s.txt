I searched the area, but I couldn't find anything resembling a key.
Inside the drawer by the bedside, I found a small wood fragment.
What is this...? It looks like a piece of parquetry.
＃Protagonist
「...I suppose I'll hang onto this for now.」
There's nothing unusual inside.
Items that Kousei-san likely used remain inside the drawer.
There's nothing particularly eye-catching inside.

The organ Kousei-san used has been left exactly as it was.
He must have done his composing here as well.
It's the organ Kousei-san used.
A beautiful painting is on display.
Looking closely, I see it's signed "S. TSUJIMURA."
It appears to be a painting by Tsujimura-san.
One of Tsujimura-san's paintings is on display.
＃Protagonist
「Hm...?」
A scrap of paper is peeking out from behind the frame.
What could this be...?
『A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Five』
?Hmph, I bet you think my takoyaki tastes like shit too, don't you? Acting like you know everything without even taking a bite.
Hey, do you get it? What takoyaki needs isn't flavor?it's about making the customer who bought it feel a little bit of happiness.
Whether it tastes good or bad isn't what's truly necessary. At least, that's how I've lived my life.
The man's verbal assault didn't stop. I felt a deep sense of pity from the bottom of my heart, thinking he must have lived a remarkably miserable life. ~To be continued~
＃Protagonist
「...What the hell is this?」
A scrap of paper titled 'A Certain Man's Story: Chapter Five' is tucked inside.
A large painting is on display.
The artist's name is... "Mamiya Shinzou," it seems.
A large painting is on display.
An easy chair has been placed here.
I wonder if Kousei-san used to sit here lost in thought...
An easy chair has been placed here.
It's a large bed.
The sheets are perfectly smooth, as if it hasn't been used for a long time.
This must be the bed Kousei-san used.
A photograph is on display.
Is this Maya-san when she was young...?
A photograph of Maya-san in her youth is on display.
The fire in the hearth has been extinguished.
There should be no problem investigating it.
I peer deep into the chimney, but there's nothing there.
It happened just as I moved the ash pan aside.
＃Protagonist
「Ah?」
＃Narumi
「Did you find something?」
Narumi-san peers in beside me.
＃Protagonist
「Is this... a keyhole?」
A small hole has been bored into the floor of the fireplace.
＃Narumi
「It looks that way... maybe this bottom section opens up.」
＃Protagonist
「Can you open it?」
＃Narumi
「I wonder...」
Narumi-san crouches down and inserts a wire into the keyhole on the floor.
＃Narumi
「The first time with a lock is always the hardest...」
Narumi-san struggled with it for a while, but eventually stood up, seemingly having given up.
＃Narumi
「It'll be faster to just find the actual key.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... but where would the real key be...?」
＃Narumi
「To begin with, it was a mistake to decode the second half of the cipher first. I think we'll get the key once we solve the first half.」
＃Protagonist
「The first half...?」
The first half of '1SO K H5 / 1SN KAMIN'.
＃Protagonist
「At the very least, I think we've established that '1SN KAMIN' refers to the fireplace in the north of the second floor...」
Just then, Narumi-san clapped her hands together.
＃Narumi
「I've got it! It's the European floor numbering. Didn't they call the first floor the ground floor?」
＃Protagonist
「So the second floor is '1F'... which makes it '1S' in this case.」
＃Narumi
「So the first half is also on the second floor... but where's 'O'?」
＃Protagonist
「Could it be the center...? But there's nothing in the middle of the second floor.」
＃Narumi
「...Well, we'll manage somehow if we just keep at it like we did when we found this place.」
＃Protagonist
「But 'K H5' isn't as obvious as a fireplace...」
＃Narumi
「But it's definitely something, so let's give it a shot.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
There's no point in investigating here further until we find the key.
