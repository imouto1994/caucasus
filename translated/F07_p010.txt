"...So, did anything happen while you were locked in the basement together, just the two of you?"
#Protagonist
"N-Nothing happened...!"
#Maya
"Narumi? Her talent for cooking is magnificent. Though... I wish she would be a bit more serious..."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Ai
"Narumi-san? Her cooking is always delicious... but, well, her other work is a bit..."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Shion
"I heard you were locked in the basement... were you all right?"
#Protagonist
"Yes... I'm fine."
#Tsujimura
"As for Mistress Minakami... it would be a help to me as well if she worked properly at things other than cooking..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I heard Minakami-kun was also locked in the basement. I'm glad she's safe, but..."
#Protagonist
"Yeah..."
#Mikanagi
"Narumi-san? Her cooking is wonderful. As for anything else... I don't really know."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Akane
"If it's Narumi-san, she's likely in her room or the dining hall... since she can't get into the kitchen."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Narumi
"...Maybe I should've just pounced on you in the basement."
#Protagonist
"...What are you saying...?"
