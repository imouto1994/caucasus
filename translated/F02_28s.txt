The world outside is a wall of white; I can’t see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard is ever going to let up...
The storm outside seems to be getting even more violent.
I don't really feel the need to go right now...
I’ll come back if I have to.
I don't really have any business here.
It’s a locker where cleaning supplies and such are kept.
It contains things like rags and buckets.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It’s a perfectly ordinary mirror.
Naturally, it's very clean and not at all foggy.
A mirror hangs upon the wall.
When I turn the tap, ice-cold water comes out.
As expected, this might be a bit rough during this season.
The water has become very cold.
