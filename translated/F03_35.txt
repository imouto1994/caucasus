I came to the western corridor on the second floor.
#Akane
"Ah..."
Akane-san was in front of Ai-san's room.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san, what's wrong?"
#Akane
"Lady Ai is nowhere to be found."
#Protagonist
"Ai-san is...?"
#Akane
"Yes... she's not in her room either..."
Akane-san stared at the door to Ai-san's room with a helpless look.
#Akane
"Um, have you seen her anywhere?"
#Protagonist
"She was there when everyone gathered, but I don't know after that."
#Protagonist
"When I... took Shion-san to the infirmary, I was with Ai-san for a bit... but I don't know after that."
#Akane
"I see..."
Somehow, I had a very bad premonition.
Souko-san had said that there was a possibility it would still continue.
Surely not—but...
#Protagonist
"...Let's look for her."
#Akane
"Y-Yes!"
Now that it had come to this, I couldn't just stand still.
If... if Ai-san had been taken away by the culprit, I have to save her no matter what.
