I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Huh... I guess he's not in."
Even after waiting, there was no response.
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san peeked out.
＃Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Do you have a moment?"
＃Tsujimura
"I was thinking of doing a bit of cleaning in the chapel, actually..."
＃Protagonist
"Cleaning...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Yes... after using it for the wedding, I simply locked it up immediately... do you think it would be better if I didn't touch it just yet...?"
＃Protagonist
"Well..."
Leave it as it is
It's fine
I'll do it
＃Protagonist
"...I think it would be better if you left it as it is."
＃Tsujimura
"...I suppose you're right."
Tsujimura-san's shoulders slumped slightly.
＃Protagonist
"It would be a serious matter if you cleaned up some crucial evidence, after all."
＃Tsujimura
"Yes... I understand."
＃Protagonist
"Well then, I'll be going."
I decided to head for another location.
＃Protagonist
"I think it'll be fine. The chapel has nothing to do with the incident, after all."
＃Tsujimura
"I see. Then I shall go tidy up... I just can't seem to settle my mind unless I'm working."
Tsujimura-san gave a faint, weary smile.
＃Protagonist
"Well then, I'll be going."
I decided to head for another location.
＃Protagonist
"I'll handle the cleaning for you."
＃Tsujimura
"No, I couldn't let a guest... ah, no... I suppose if anything were to happen and I had tidied it up, the suspicion would fall on me...?"
＃Protagonist
"...Yes, that’s exactly it. I don't think I have everyone's complete trust, but even so, I believe I'm more suited for it."
＃Tsujimura
"...You're right. Then... I leave it to you."
Tsujimura-san took out a key and handed it to me.
＃Protagonist
"...Given the current situation, I don't think I'll be able to get much cleaning done, though..."
＃Tsujimura
"I don't mind. There's something... you wish to investigate, isn't there?"
＃Protagonist
"Well..."
＃Tsujimura
"...I'm counting on you."
Tsujimura-san bowed his head deeply once more.
＃Protagonist
"...Well then, excuse me."
Now then... let's go take a look.
I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room again.
I knock on the door.
＃Tsujimura
"Yes, who is it?"
＃Protagonist
"Hello, Tsujimura-san."
＃Tsujimura
"Ah, it was you. What is it this time?"
＃Protagonist
"Do you have a moment?"
＃Tsujimura
"Yes, I don't mind. Please, come inside."
＃Protagonist
"Excuse me."
I enter Tsujimura-san's room.
＃Tsujimura
"What can I do for you?"
