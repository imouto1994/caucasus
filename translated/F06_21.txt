I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in.
I knock on the door.
＃Benio
「Yes... oh, it's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?」
＃Benio
「I don't mind. Come in.」
Benio-san invited me into her room.
＃Benio
「So, what do you want?」
＃Protagonist
「Did you notice the explosion earlier?」
＃Benio
「Explosion...? Was there such a thing?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, well... it seems something was rigged in the kitchen.」
＃Benio
「Any injuries?」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san suffered a light injury.」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san suffered a light injury.」
＃Benio
「I see... no threat to her life, then?」
＃Protagonist
「No.」
＃Benio
「That’s good to hear. ...I think I’ll go take a look myself later.」
＃Protagonist
「Please be careful.」
＃Benio
「I know. Is that all?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Benio
「Who is it... oh, you again.」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?」
＃Benio
「Well, I don't mind.」
Benio-san invited me into her room.
＃Benio
「So, what do you want?」
Benio-san asks with a formal tone.
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Huh... I guess she's not in.」
No matter how long I wait, there is no response.
She must be somewhere else.
I decided to head for another location as well.
I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I have no more business here, but...
＃Protagonist
「...Let's head elsewhere.」
I offered a brief, silent prayer toward the door and decided to move on.
