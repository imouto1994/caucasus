I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
I wait for a while, but there was no response from inside.
Is she not here?
I gave up and decided to head elsewhere.
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Souko
"Yes... oh, it's you."
A sleepy-looking Souko-san appeared.
#Protagonist
"Were you sleeping?"
#Souko
"Yeah. I guess I was more exhausted than I thought. More importantly, what's with this blackout? I woke up and tried to turn on the light, but nothing happened."
#Protagonist
"I think the power will be restored soon..."
#Souko
"Are you investigating it?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah, well..."
#Souko
"Be careful. At this point, nothing would surprise me anymore."
#Protagonist
"You're right... you be careful too, Souko-san."
#Souko
"I'm planning to stay in my room, so you don't need to worry too much about me."
#Protagonist
"Understood. Then, please stay put until the electricity is fixed."
#Souko
"Actually, I think now would be a better time to investigate various parts of this house."
#Protagonist
"Please, just bear with it for now."
#Souko
"I know. Well then, see you later."
#Protagonist
"Yeah, see you."
Souko-san returned to her room.
Now then—I'll head somewhere else as well.
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Souko
"What is it this time?"
#Protagonist
"No, I didn't really have any business, but I'm doing a quick patrol just in case."
#Souko
"I see... just be careful you don't get attacked from the shadows, okay?"
#Protagonist
"Please don't say scary things like that..."
#Souko
"I'm joking. But... it's best to be careful."
#Protagonist
"Yeah... I know."
I bowed to Souko-san and decided to look around other areas.
