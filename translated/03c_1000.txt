I returned to my own room.
Why... why did one troublesome thing have to happen after another?
Akane-san disappeared, Shion-san was targeted...
And the day has only just begun...
Where on earth did Akane-san go?
Inside the building?
Outside the building?
Or has she already fallen into the killer's hands...?
I don't even want to think about that.
She must be safe somewhere.
...But if so, why did she disappear?
Akane-san's actions last night.
She was investigating something.
What was she investigating?
The handkerchief embroidered with "Akari·M" that she dropped then.
I wonder if that has anything to do with Akane-san's disappearance...
The more I think about it, the more I don't understand.
＃Protagonist
「Whew...」
I collapsed onto the bed.
I want to go look for Akane-san, but I don't even have a clue where to look anymore.
If she really did go outside...
No, even if she didn't, all I could do now was pray for her safety.
There was a knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Yes...?」
＃Narumi
「It's Mizumori.」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san...?」
I unlock the door.
＃Protagonist
「What is it?」
＃Narumi
「It's about Akane, just for a moment.」
＃Protagonist
「Was she found?」
＃Narumi
「Not yet... but I remembered something that might be a tiny clue.」
＃Protagonist
「A clue...?」
＃Narumi
「It seems she had been worrying about something for a little while now. ...Ever since Rokuyou-san started staying here.」
＃Protagonist
「Rokuyou-san...?」
＃Narumi
「Yes... maybe there's some connection... but Akane didn't seem particularly upset yesterday...」
＃Protagonist
「...Are you saying something happened with Rokuyou-san?」
＃Narumi
「...Something might have, though I don't have any proof.」
Narumi-san shook her head.
＃Narumi
「I want to help her as much as I can as a colleague... that girl has a habit of forcing herself to act cheerful, after all.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Narumi
「It's certain Akane was up to something, so it might be worth looking into that.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
＃Narumi
「Well, I'll be going now.」
Narumi-san left the room.
This is no time for me to be taking it easy, either.
I need to start moving.
