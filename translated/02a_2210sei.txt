I arrived at Tsujimura-san's room on the north side of the first floor.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san stepped out into the hallway.
＃Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Um, I've decided to stay here tonight to protect you from the culprit, Tsujimura-san."
＃Tsujimura
"Pardon...? But is there even any proof that someone like myself would be targeted by the culprit?"
＃Protagonist
"...I don't know for sure. But... given the current situation, it wouldn't be strange no matter who's being targeted."
＃Tsujimura
"Haha... I'll be fine. Besides, patrolling the manor is my responsibility, after all."
＃Protagonist
"But..."
＃Tsujimura
"You're a guest, so please get some rest in your room. I'll let you know if anything happens."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
Having been told that, I had no words to offer in return.
＃Protagonist
"...Well then, excuse me. Um, sorry for bringing up such a strange thing."
＃Tsujimura
"No, no, please don't worry about it. Well then, good night."
＃Protagonist
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
