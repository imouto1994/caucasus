I arrived at Tsujimura-san's room on the north side of the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san stepped out into the hallway.
#Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"Um, I've decided to stay here tonight to protect you from the culprit, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Pardon...? But is there even any proof that someone like myself would be targeted by the culprit?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know for sure. But... given the current situation, it wouldn't be strange no matter who's being targeted."
#Tsujimura
"Haha... I'll be fine. Besides, patrolling the manor is my responsibility, after all."
#Satoshi
"But..."
#Tsujimura
"You're a guest, so please get some rest in your room. I'll let you know if anything happens."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
Having been told that, I had no words to offer in return.
#Satoshi
"...Well then, excuse me. Um, sorry for bringing up such a strange thing."
#Tsujimura
"No, no, please don't worry about it. Well then, good night."
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
