「That is something my husband purchased before the war. He went to the trouble of importing it all the way from Germany.」

＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Tsujimura

「I don't mind if you play it, but don't go breaking it.」
＃Protagonist

「A piano...? It seems to be a very old instrument. Apparently it was one of Kousei-san's favorites.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi

＃Protagonist
「I see...」
