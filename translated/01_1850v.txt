"The west wing consists of our family's private quarters. My mother's room is at the end, my elder sister's is on the far left, and mine is next to it."
After giving that brief explanation, Benio-san turned on her heel.
Well, since no one was there, it was only natural.
We circled around the balcony overlooking the hall and proceeded into the opposite corridor.
#Benio
"At the end of this hall is the music room. There's also a room for instrument storage and another for sheet music."
#Souko
"Was it used by Kousei-shi?"
#Benio
"It was, while he was alive. I use it myself these days, but you're more than welcome to use it as you like."
#Protagonist
"I can't play a single instrument, though."
#Souko
"You could always just sit there and bang a pair of castanets."
Souko-san teased me as I scratched my head.
#Benio
"Fufu... I believe there might be a pair of castanets in the instrument storage."
#Protagonist
"No, really, don't take her seriously."
#Benio
"I'll have the vacant room on the front right prepared for you, Kirihara-san."
#Souko
"Yes, thank you."
#Benio
"And finally, the northern section. There's one more vacancy here, so I'll make that your room."
#Protagonist
"Sorry for all the trouble."
Benio-san led the way into the final corridor.
#Benio
"The room at the very end was used by my father. On the far left is Hakase's room, across from that is the study, and next to that is the infirmary."
#Protagonist
"So, will this be my room?"
I asked, pointing to the door next to Mikanagi-sensei's.
#Benio
"Yes, that's the one. Now, do you have any other questions?"
Souko-san raised her hand in response to Benio-san's inquiry.
#Souko
"Would it be alright if I had a look inside Kousei-san's room?"
#Benio
"I'm afraid... that isn't possible. It has been kept closed ever since my father passed away."
#Protagonist
"A forbidden room...?"
#Benio
"That is indeed the case."
#Souko
"One more thing—where are the baths?"
#Benio
"Don't worry, each room has its own bathroom. We pump water up from underground, so hot water is available instantly."
#Souko
"I see, thank you."
