...Morning came.
Checking the clock, it was 7:00 AM.
Somehow... I’ve made it to morning.
It’s a very warm morning.
Well... I suppose that’s only natural since I’m wrapped in a futon.
As I try to sit up, I realize I can't move.
My arm was being held tight.
...By Benio-san.
＃Benio
"...Zzz."
She’s sound asleep.
Just looking at her sleeping face, I think she’s truly cute.
...As long as she doesn't talk.
Actually, this situation is more than a little dangerous.
Even as I try to pull my arm away, she’s holding it so firmly that it won't budge.
＃Protagonist
"Benio-san, please wake up."
I give her body a gentle shake.
＃Benio
"Nnh..."
...She roughly swiped my hand away.
＃Protagonist
"Come on, Benio-san, get up."
＃Benio
"...I'm awake."
She mutters with her eyes still squeezed shut.
＃Protagonist
"...Then please let go of my hand."
＃Benio
"Mhm..."
She nodded, but showed no sign of actually letting go.
＃Protagonist
"Benio-san..."
＃Benio
"You've been noisy for a while now..."
Benio-san finally opened her eyes.
＃Benio
"—!?"
＃Protagonist
"Good mor—"
＃Benio
"Wha-wha... what do you think you're doing, you absolute moron!?"
＃Protagonist
"I-I'm not doing anything..."
I shook my head, groaning while holding my struck face.
＃Protagonist
"Benio-san, weren't you the one who invited me in the middle of the night...?"
＃Benio
"Don't say such scandalous things!"
＃Protagonist
"You were the one who said if I was cold I should come over here, remember...?"
＃Benio
"...Did I?"
Benio-san blinked.
＃Protagonist
"Yes, you did."
＃Benio
"Muu..."
Benio-san fell into thought.
＃Protagonist
"...In any case, I'm glad nothing happened."
＃Benio
"...Were you planning on making something happen, you bastard...?"
＃Protagonist
"No! I mean I'm glad we weren't attacked by the killer."
＃Benio
"...Though I felt like I was about to be attacked by someone who isn't the killer."
...It seems she's going to hold a grudge about this.
＃Benio
"But... well, I suppose I should thank you. ...Thanks."
Benio-san bowed her head toward me.
＃Protagonist
"No... I just did what I could."
＃Benio
"...There are more things you can't do than things you can. ...Now, I'm going to change, so go to the hall or somewhere first."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, understood. I'll see you later."
I left Benio-san's room.
