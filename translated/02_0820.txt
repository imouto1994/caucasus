The moment I stepped inside, I knew something was wrong.
There, on the bed in the freezing room.
Rokuyou-san was lying face down.
The pillow that had been placed over his head was torn to shreds.
#Protagonist
"Eh...?"
It was red.
What... is this?
#Benio
"...No way."
Benio-san whispered.
It wasn't that the pillow had been placed over his head.
Rokuyou-san's head itself was gone.
#Tsujimura
"Th... this is... monstrous..."
Tsujimura-san was speechless.
#Souko
"What on earth..."
Even Souko-san, who had returned with the chapel key, was at a loss for words before the grotesque sight on the bed.
#Benio
"...There's no need to check for a pulse."
#Souko
"...Agreed."
The two of them nodded to each other.
I was frozen, unable to do anything, so I turned to Tsujimura-san behind me.
#Protagonist
"What do we do... Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"...First, we must confirm that Shion-ojousama is safe."
#Protagonist
"...Right."
We decided to leave Rokuyou-san’s room for the time being.
