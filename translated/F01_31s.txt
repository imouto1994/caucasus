Small medicine bottles are lined up.
With my knowledge, I have no idea what most of these medicines are.
I shouldn't mess with them, so I'll just leave them be.
It's probably best not to mess with them.
There's something that looks like medicine inside.
I wonder if it's for herbal medicine; something that looks like tree roots is also stored here.
It's probably best not to mess with them.
Disinfectants, bandages, and such seem to be placed here.

Some documents are placed on the desk.
I probably shouldn't look at them without permission.

Snow is dancing outside the window.
The wind seems to have grown quite strong.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
There's another door, separate from the one I entered through.
It probably connects to the adjacent archive.
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
A simple bed, completely different from the ones in the other rooms, is placed here.
Well, it's an infirmary, so that makes sense...
There's no sign of the bed being used.
Various documents are stored here.
I really shouldn't look at them without permission...

In the bottom drawer, I found a pretty card.
＃Protagonist
"What's this...?"
The card had the letter 'r' written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll hold onto it.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and answer the question! The response section on the survey postcard was meant for this!"
＃Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I'm a little curious, so I'll hold onto this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Now all the cards have been collected! As for the question you're wondering about... if you rearrange the letters so far, they'll form a certain word."
"Answer with a Japanese translation appropriate for this work and send in the survey postcard!"
"Deadline: Postmarked by January 11, 2010! 10 winners chosen by lottery will receive a small gift!"
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
I kind of get it, but also not really...
Nothing unusual is inside.
