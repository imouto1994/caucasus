"—What do you think you're doing?"
Benio-san's voice came from behind us.
#Narumi
"B-Benio-ojousama..."
#Benio
"...I believe the doctor told you not to do anything reckless?"
#Main Character
"Um... we haven't done anything reckless yet..."
#Benio
"Don't make excuses, you idiot."
#Main Character
"I'm sorry..."
We couldn't exactly break the piano, so I decided it was best to stop.

#Narumi
"...We'll just have to give up on this for now."
#Main Character
"Then... I'm going to go check on Shion-san."
#Narumi
"Shion-ojousama? Did you think of something?"
#Main Character
"Just a little... I don't have any proof, though."
#Narumi
"...I see. Be careful."
#Main Character
"...Right."
