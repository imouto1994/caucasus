"It looks like we'll be able to leave tomorrow... but I wonder if I'll be able to research the Nanatsuki legends by then..."
#Protagonist
"I wonder..."
#Maya
"Please tell Kirihara-san that if she has any inconveniences, she should not hesitate to speak up."
#Protagonist
"Yes, I'll let her know."
#Ai
"Kirihara-san is quite composed, isn't she? Even in a situation like this..."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Benio
"She seems to be investigating quite a bit herself. She might even know more about this place than you do, for all we know."
#Protagonist
"I-Is that so..."
#Shion
"Kirihara-san... she has a somewhat frightening atmosphere about her..."
#Protagonist
"Do you think so...?"
#Tsujimura
"Kirihara-sama is a very knowledgeable person. I heard she even helped with the generator repair..."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Takamine
"It seems you and the others are playing detective... but it's best not to provoke the culprit more than necessary."
#Protagonist
"That might be true, but..."
#Mikanagi
"I examined Kirihara-san's finger again this morning, and it still seems a bit swollen. I told her she should get it checked at a hospital once we leave here."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"Kirihara-sama? Wouldn't she be in her room?"
#Protagonist
"Well... likely so..."
#Narumi
"Kirihara-san? ...No idea."
#Protagonist
"I-I see..."
