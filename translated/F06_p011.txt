「You're right...」
＃Ai
「Isamu-san... why...?」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」

「...I have my doubts about whether Rokuyou truly loved Shion. I never once saw them acting affectionately toward each other.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that how it was...?」
＃Shion
「What on earth could have happened...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I'm currently in the middle of investigating that.」

＃Protagonist
「That's true...」

「It seems Rokuyou-kun was killed during the night... but there were no sounds of a struggle. It might be because the rooms are well soundproofed...」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」

＃Protagonist
「You're right...」

「Akane-san...」
＃Narumi
「...I thought it was strange when he didn't show his face this morning, but I never dreamed he'd been murdered...」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
