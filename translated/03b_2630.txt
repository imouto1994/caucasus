I returned to my own room.
I believe the one who killed Dr. Mikanagi... was Shion-san.
No, the crime would have been impossible for anyone else.
However... I still don't understand the motive.
Did she really have a reason to kill Dr. Mikanagi?
And the other crimes as well...
The matter of Rokuyou-san.
Certainly, Shion-san is the most likely suspect there.
Did she simply despise the idea of the marriage...?
The matter of Ai-san.
She was her sister, and they were supposedly close...
The matter of Benio-san.
Was it... a grudge?
It wouldn't be strange if Shion-san, as an adoptee, harbored some kind of resentment.
To be honest, I just don't know.
That night, Shion-san was showing symptoms like sleepwalking.
If I had left without noticing...
Souko-san... she likely realized Shion-san was the culprit.
That's why—
In that case, what about Akane-san's existence...?
Was Akane-san killed as well?
Shion-san's objective... her next target—
#Main Character
"...Maya-san."
It's not hard to imagine her being targeted.
In fact... Maya-san might be the true primary target.
I couldn't just stay here.
I have to stop this.
Once more, back to Shion-san—
#Main Character
"...I should consult with Souko-san."
I can't make any more judgments on my own.
If it's Souko-san, she'll be able to make the decisions I can't.
Or—she might even be able to prove her innocence.
