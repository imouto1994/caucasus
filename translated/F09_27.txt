I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Peeking inside, I see Souko-san staring at the blood-written message on the wall.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「...Oh, it's you.」
A slight smile flickers across Souko-san's face.
＃Protagonist
「Were you investigating?」
＃Souko
「In a way. It's hard not to be curious about this.」
＃Protagonist
「That's for sure...」
＃Souko
「Did you need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Uh, well...」
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Peeking inside, I see Souko-san staring at the blood-written message on the wall.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「...Oh, it's you. Do you need something again?」
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Peeking inside, I see Benio-san staring at the blood-written message on the wall with a grim expression.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Benio-san.」
＃Benio
「Hm... It's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Were you investigating?」
＃Benio
「Yes. It was bothering me a bit.」
Benio-san touched the writing on the wall.
＃Benio
「...I wonder who wrote this.」
＃Protagonist
「Isn't it... obviously the killer?」
＃Benio
「...If so, why send something like this to her?」
＃Protagonist
「...Maybe because she was investigating the case?」
＃Benio
「You've been investigating as well, haven't you?」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe she was closer to the truth than I am...」
＃Benio
「Hmm...」
Benio-san falls silent.
＃Benio
「...Perhaps they're getting impatient because things aren't going as planned.」
＃Protagonist
「Impatient? You mean the killer?」
＃Benio
「Yes.」
＃Protagonist
「Why would they be?」
＃Benio
「Because I'm still alive after being attacked. Naturally, I haven't let my guard down since then. It's only natural the target would shift to her, as she's digging quite deep.」
＃Protagonist
「...I'll go tell her to be careful.」
＃Benio
「Yes, that would be wise.」
I decided to leave the room in a hurry.
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Benio-san was in the room.
＃Benio
「Oh, what is it this time?」
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... is no one here?」
She probably has no more business here.
I decided to go somewhere else.
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Peeking inside, I see Takamine-san.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... Takamine-san.」
＃Takamine
「...It's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Are you investigating?」
＃Takamine
「Yes.」
Answering with few words, Takamine-san stared at the blood-written message on the wall.
＃Protagonist
「Can you tell anything from it?」
＃Takamine
「...It's all Greek to a layman like me.」
＃Protagonist
「The killer wrote this, right?」
＃Takamine
「I can't imagine anyone else having such twisted taste.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Takamine
「Do you need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, uh...」
I've arrived at the room Souko-san had been using.
The door is wide open.
Peeking inside, I see Takamine-san.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Takamine-san.」
＃Takamine
「You again. Do you need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, uh...」
