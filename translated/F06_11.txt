I’ve come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she isn't here.
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while.
＃Narumi
"Yes... oh, it's you. What's up?"
＃Protagonist
"I just came to see how you were doing... are you alright?"
＃Narumi
"Ah, yeah. I just got my hand singed a bit, so don't worry about it. This kind of thing happens all the time when you're cooking."
＃Protagonist
"I don't think this is the kind of thing that happens 'all the time'..."
At the very least, I don't think normal cooking involves explosions.
＃Narumi
"The bigger problem is that it looks like I won't be able to cook anything that uses fire... I might be able to manage a salad or something, though..."
＃Protagonist
"What do you plan to do for lunch?"
＃Narumi
"There are vegetables in the basement, so I'll manage somehow with those."
＃Protagonist
"...Truthfully, this is a situation where we shouldn't even be worrying about meals."
＃Narumi
"It can't be helped; you can't exactly suppress an appetite."
＃Protagonist
"...I hope we can get out of here tomorrow."
＃Narumi
"Yeah."
＃Protagonist
"Well then, I'll take my leave."
＃Narumi
"Hm, see you later."
I decided to head for another location.
I’ve come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while.
＃Narumi
"Yes... you again. What now?"
＃Protagonist
"No, I don't really have any business, but..."
＃Narumi
"Are you hungry? I'm going to make something in a bit, so just bear with it until then."
＃Protagonist
"U-Understood..."
I bowed and left the area.
