When we entered the corridor where Benio-san’s room was located, we found Tsujimura-san knocking on her door.
＃Tsujimura
「Benio-ojousama, please wake up. It’s already seven.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「Ah, oh... Good morning.」
Tsujimura-san turned and gave us a polite bow.
＃Narumi
「She's still not out?」
＃Tsujimura
「No... We have the rest of the ceremony to attend to, so it’s quite a problem if she doesn't wake up...」
Muttering that, Tsujimura-san knocked on the door again.
＃Tsujimura
「Ojousama, please wake up!」
＃Souko
「Is it always like this?」
Souko-san asked Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
「Usually she sleeps until noon. Tsujimura-san, should I just head inside and drag her out of bed?」
＃Tsujimura
「The door is locked, so that’s not an option. ...Ojousama!」
The door finally opened.
Benio-san emerged with an expression that suggested she was still half-asleep.
＃Tsujimura
「Good morning, Benio-ojousama.」
＃Benio
「...You’re being damn noisy, Tsujimura.」
Benio-san muttered in a low, gravelly voice.
＃Benio
「I told you I was awake. Stop pounding on the door over and over, I get it.」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, yes, of course you do.」
Tsujimura-san nodded with a pleasant smile.
He seemed very accustomed to this.
＃Narumi
「Our guests are right here, Ojousama. Shouldn't you at least try to look presentable?」
＃Benio
「Nn...?」
Benio-san turned her gaze toward us.
＃Benio
「I can't be bothered. I'm done with the act.」
＃Protagonist
「...Oh.」
She was remarkably blunt. I wondered if it was really alright to act like that in front of guests.
＃Benio
「Anyway, who was the one who brought these sudden guests here in the first place...?」
＃Protagonist
「Uhh...」
That would definitely be you, Benio-san.
＃Souko
「Where is Ai-san?」
＃Narumi
「Ai-ojousama should already be in the Great Hall. She’s an early riser.」
＃Benio
「Well, now everyone's going to think I'm a lazy lie-abed, aren't they?」
＃Tsujimura
「There’s no need to worry. Please, go ahead and get changed.」
Benio-san obediently followed Tsujimura-san's advice and went back into her room.
＃Souko
「...Shouldn't you go change too? You're still in yesterday's clothes.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-yeah, you're right...」
＃Narumi
「I'll take care of the laundry for you, so just leave your dirty clothes somewhere easy to find in your room.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
＃Souko
「I’m heading downstairs first.」
Souko-san waved her hand, which was still wrapped in tape-secured bandages.
I’d better get back to my room.
