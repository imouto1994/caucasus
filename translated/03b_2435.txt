The first to arrive was Souko-san.
#Souko
"Just what on earth happened...?"
#Protagonist
"Dr. Mikanagi is..."
I felt that the current situation, where you could know what happened just from that, was incredibly abnormal.
#Souko
"Again...?"
Souko-san peered into the room and was left speechless.
#Protagonist
"...I was talking to Dr. Mikanagi just a short while ago. But... in just ten minutes or so..."
#Souko
"...Did anyone go in or out?"
Souko-san asked, pointing to the bloodstains on the floor.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san was... the first to discover him. She was covered in blood... she's at the clinic now."
#Souko
"...I see."
Tsujimura-san and the others came running.
#Tsujimura
"U-Um, Dr. Mikanagi is..."
#Protagonist
"Yes..."
#Tsujimura
"Oh... how can this be..."
#Souko
"Tsujimura-san, Shion-san is in the clinic. Her clothes are also soiled, so..."
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes..."
Tsujimura-san trudged into the clinic.
#Souko
"...Let's investigate the room. Although... there's no one left who can perform an autopsy."
