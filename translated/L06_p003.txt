"Even if Ai-san died during the second blackout... we should probably scrutinize everyone's movements starting from the first blackout."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"To think Ai has been murdered... I simply don't know what to do anymore..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Benio
"...So my sister was targeted again... The killer seems remarkably persistent..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"Lady Ai... How could this have happened..."
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Ai... Why did this happen...?"
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Takamine
"So even Ai-kun was killed... What on earth is the killer's intent!?"
#Satoshi
"I... I don't know..."
#Mikanagi
"...If the head were found, the cause of death would be clearer... but given the situation, I can only call it death by electrocution for now."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"...You were with Lady Ai, weren't you...? If only you had been a little more attentive..."
#Satoshi
"...I'm sorry."
#Narumi
"It was during a blackout, after all... If only someone had been doing proper rounds..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
