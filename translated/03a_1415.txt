I went up the stairs.
Akane-san went to check on Dr. Mikanagi, so she should be on the north side where my room is.
It was while I was walking down the corridor.
#Main Character
"Wait—?"
A strange noise.
I turned my gaze toward the sound—the eastern corridor.
At the end of the hall.
The door to the performance room was open.
#Main Character
"—!? Benio-san!?"
I saw Benio-san collapsed on the floor and immediately started running.
#Main Character
"Benio-san!"
#Benio
"Guh... nnh..."
The fallen Benio-san grimaced and opened her eyes slightly.
Thank God—she's alive...
#Main Character
"A-Are you okay...?"
#Benio
"...Of course I'm not okay, you idiot..."
Benio-san reached for the back of her head.
#Benio
"Dammit... feels like I was hit from behind..."
#Main Character
"Please stay still. I'll go get Dr. Mikanagi—"
#Benio
"...Wait."
Benio-san tugged hard on my sleeve.
#Main Character
"What is it...?"
#Benio
"...It just happened. That bastard might still be around."
Benio-san whispered through a wince.
#Main Character
"...Do you know who hit you?"
I asked while keeping an eye on our surroundings.
#Benio
"No... I don't know."
There was no sign of anyone in the performance room.
There was nowhere to hide.
Just a grand piano sitting on the stage.
#Benio
"But... take this—"
Benio-san pressed something into my hand.
#Main Character
"This is—?"
#Akane
"Is something wrong!?"
Akane-san burst into the room through the open door.
#Akane
"Eh... Benio-ojousama!?"
#Main Character
"Akane-san, go get Dr. Mikanagi!"
#Akane
"Y-Yes!"
She dashed back out through the door she'd just entered.
#Souko
"What happened?"
Souko-san entered as if taking her place.
#Souko
"Benio-san...!?"
#Main Character
"Souko-san, be careful. The culprit might still be nearby."
#Souko
"Was she attacked...?"
#Benio
"Nn... yeah..."
Benio-san answered sluggishly.
She seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness.
#Main Character
"Stay with us, Benio-san...!"
#Benio
"...I'm fine."
Just then, Akane-san returned with Dr. Mikanagi.
#Main Character
"Dr. Mikanagi...!"
#Mikanagi
"Make some room."
Dr. Mikanagi knelt beside Benio-san and began his examination.
#Mikanagi
"She might have a concussion. It's best not to move her for a while."
He applied an ice pack to the back of Benio-san's head.
#Souko
"...Did you see the culprit?"
#Main Character
"No... I only saw Benio-san right after she fell. I rushed over immediately... but the culprit wasn't there."
#Souko
"If they were going to hide—"
Souko-san looked around and pointed at two doors.
#Souko
"There are two rooms you can reach directly from this performance room—the storage room for instruments and the sheet music room."
#Main Character
"...Could they be inside...?"
#Souko
"...Let's check. You take that one."
Souko-san pointed to the door leading to the sheet music room.
I grabbed the doorknob and swallowed hard.
#Souko
"Ready? On three!"
...There was no one inside.
I checked behind everything just in case, but there was nowhere for a person to hide.
I went back into the corridor.
Souko-san emerged from the opposite door at the same time.
#Main Character
"Not here..."
#Souko
"Nothing on this side either. When on earth did they slip away...?"
Souko-san looked down the hallway.
Benio-san was still lying in the performance room.
#Main Character
"...Is it possible they escaped through the window...?"
I went back inside and approached the window.
The snow had weakened, so I could just barely see outside.
#Souko
"I don't think there was time to open that window and jump."
#Main Character
"You're right... and if they went out this way, there would be tracks below..."
#Souko
"They definitely used one of the adjacent rooms as an escape route. The question is when they slipped out... Do you remember anything?"
#Main Character
"I wasn't watching the corridor the whole time... Souko-san, did you notice anything from your room?"
#Souko
"I only came out because I noticed Akane-san running... other than that, nothing."
#Main Character
"What about Akane-san?"
#Akane
"I was startled by the voice calling for Benio-ojousama... and I came out of the clinic."
Akane-san looked up at the ceiling, as if trying to recall that moment.
#Main Character
"...So no one saw anyone leaving this area..."
#Mikanagi
"Can I have a moment? I want to take Benio-san to the clinic..."
#Main Character
"Oh, I'll help."
Overthinking wasn't going to get us anywhere.
For now, I should just be glad Benio-san is safe.
