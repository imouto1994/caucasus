Eight o'clock arrived, so I made my way to the Great Hall.
The residents of the estate were already gathering there, looking prepared.
＃Benio
「The guest of honor is late.」
Benio-san muttered to no one in particular.
＃Ai
「Now that you mention it, where is Isamu-san?」
＃Mikanagi
「In his room, perhaps? I doubt he'd still be asleep, but...」
Ai-san and Mikanagi-sensei exchanged glances.
＃Souko
「Come to think of it, I haven't seen Rokuyou-san either. How about you?」
＃Protagonist
「I haven't seen him.」
I'd spent the last thirty minutes wandering around, but I hadn't run into him.
＃Maya
「Tsujimura, what is the meaning of this?」
＃Tsujimura
「It is quite strange...」
＃Maya
「It is already time. Go and fetch him at once.」
＃Takamine
「We can hardly begin without the groom present.」
Takamine-san joined the conversation between Maya-san and Tsujimura-san.
＃Narumi
「We really need to let Shion-ojousama out of there soon, too.」
Narumi-san approached and spoke to us.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san... is she still in that casket?」
＃Narumi
「The ritual is mostly just for show these days, but tradition is tradition.」
＃Akane
「I'm sure everything is fine, but...」
＃Tsujimura
「What would you have me do, Madam? Could something have happened to Rokuyou-sama...?」
＃Maya
「...It cannot be helped. Tsujimura, use the spare key and check on him.」
＃Tsujimura
「As you wish.」
Tsujimura-san left the hall.
＃Souko
「Let's go too.」
＃Protagonist
「...Right.」
I was uneasy.
It wasn't so much about Rokuyou-san, but?about Shion-san, sleeping in that casket.
