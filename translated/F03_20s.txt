It’s pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
#Protagonist
"The fire is still burning."
#Akane
"It's unlikely to start a fire, but... I believe Lady Ai was in this room until just a moment ago. ...Oh?"
Akane-san peeks into the fireplace.
#Akane
"Something fell in there... looks like a piece of paper."
#Protagonist
"Eh... you're right."
Inside the hearth, a scrap of paper was lying there.
#Protagonist
"Was she trying to burn something...?"
The paper is quite badly charred.
#Akane
"It might be a clue. Can you get it?"
#Protagonist
"...It's too hot, no way."
I certainly can't shove my hand into a roaring fire.
#Protagonist
"If I had something to use, I think I could get it..."
Use a tool
Leave it for now
Before that, let's search the room a bit more.
#Protagonist
"I think I can get it with this."
I decided to try using the poker.
I poke the rod into the fireplace and pull the paper out.
#Akane
"Hurry up, or it'll burn up completely..."
#Protagonist
"I know... there!"
I managed to drag it close enough to reach.
#Akane
"...It's mostly burnt."
#Protagonist
"It really is just a fragment..."
#Akane
"I wonder what was written on it..."
#Protagonist
"...Maybe. But we'll never know now..."
#Akane
"Ah, but this pattern... I believe it's the same as the notepad in the telephone room."
#Protagonist
"The one in the telephone room?"
#Akane
"Yes. It's kept there for jotting down messages when the phone rings... it's a bound pad of paper."
#Protagonist
"...If she wrote something there, a clue might still remain."
#Akane
"You're right."
It’s no good, I can't seem to get it.
Let's look around for something else.
I’m curious about that scrap of paper in the fireplace... I wonder how I can get it out.
I should hurry to the telephone room and check.
It's likely a door connecting to the adjacent room.
It seems to be firmly locked.
This door doesn't look like it'll open.
A painting is on display.
I don't know who the artist is, but it's a beautiful piece.
Right now, there are more important things to investigate.
Accessories and small trinkets are inside.
There's nothing that gives a clue to Ai-san's whereabouts.
I probably shouldn't be rummaging through a lady's room like this.

"Hm...?"
A scrap of paper fell out from inside a book.
What could this be...?
"Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 7"
—The man was crying. I felt a surge of deep regret. I had been so caught up in the man's aura and appearance that I failed to see the person within.
I felt ashamed. Despite working in a profession like composing, meant to give dreams and hope to people, I had failed to notice such an obvious emotion.
I should have considered the feelings the man had while grilling all that takoyaki. ~To be continued~
#Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
A scrap of paper titled "Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 7" is lying here.
I flip through the book, but there's nothing unusual about it.
It's a perfectly ordinary novel.
There are no clues to Ai-san's whereabouts.

This is the bed Ai-san uses.
I peeked under the pillow and the bed, but I couldn't find anything resembling a clue.
It's probably better to search somewhere else.
#Protagonist
"This is... a fire poker."
It's a sturdy iron rod.
#Akane
"You need it for the fireplace. To stir the logs and such."
#Protagonist
"...It might be useful for something, let's take it."
I now have the poker that was here.
