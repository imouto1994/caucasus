The fire in the fireplace is flickering.
Thanks to that, it's warm inside the room.
If we didn't have this... the thought is chilling.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the corridor side.
It seems to be connected to the adjacent room.
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
A painting is displayed on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat mournful painting.
I've already searched here, so let's look somewhere else.
This is the bed I slept in.
It was soft and I slept very well.
I just woke up, so I'm not particularly sleepy, but...
I suppose I could rest if I wanted to...
An old-fashioned, antique-style dresser is placed here.
There doesn't seem to be anything inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing in it.
It's my bag.
I've got plenty of spare clothes inside.
Since I never know when I'll be able to go home when I'm stuck with Souko-san, I always bring extra.
Other than that, there's just my notebook and writing tools.
I don't need anything right now.
