"Is this about right?"
I asked Souko-san.
#Souko
"If you say so, then I think it's fine."
#Protagonist
"Being told that makes me feel anxious, though……"
Keep investigating.
That's probably enough.
Let's try investigating a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I've investigated everything I can.
#Protagonist
"That should be enough."
#Mikanagi
"Well then…… let's pull her out."
We drained the water from the tub, and Dr. Mikanagi and I lifted Ai-san's body out together.
We laid Ai-san's body down.
#Souko
"……Could you investigate the cause of death and such?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes…… however, I might not be able to determine anything very clearly."
Dr. Mikanagi began his examination of the body.
#Mikanagi
"If the head were still here, it would be clearer, but……"
#Souko
"Can you at least determine the cause of death and the time of death?"
#Mikanagi
"……Since she was in the water, I can't give an exact figure, but I don't think it's been even an hour since she died. As for the cause of death…… I wonder which it was……"
#Protagonist
"Which…… do you mean?"
#Mikanagi
"I can't tell which came first: the electrocution or the decapitation."
Dr. Mikanagi shook his head.
#Mikanagi
"It's thought that both occurred at almost the same time. However, if the decapitation came first, I can't find any meaning in what was done afterward."
#Souko
"……True, there would be no point in electrocuting a corpse."
#Protagonist
"Then…… as I thought……"
#Mikanagi
"It's safer to assume she was decapitated after being killed by electrocution, or at least after falling unconscious from it."
#Souko
"But if that's the case, doesn't that raise a question about the timing? The second blackout was just after six, and when you found Ai-san it was——"
#Protagonist
"……Only a little over ten minutes had passed since then."
#Mikanagi
"That would be enough time to sever a neck, but…… the number of people capable of doing it would be limited."
#Souko
"Let's try questioning everyone about that later."
#Protagonist
"Um…… Souko-san."
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Could it be…… that I was the one who killed Ai-san……"
I was the one who fixed the generator.
If Ai-san died because the power was turned on——
#Souko
"……That's not true."
Souko-san placed her hand on my head.
#Protagonist
"But…… if I hadn't turned the generator back on——"
#Souko
"No. It was the culprit who set things up to turn out that way."
Souko-san said this while looking me straight in the eyes.
#Mikanagi
"……That's right. Someone had to fix the generator regardless. Besides…… Ai-san would likely have been killed even if the blackout had continued."
#Souko
"……I suppose so. I don't know why they would use such a roundabout method, though……"
Souko-san pulled on my hand.
#Souko
"Let's head back. You can ask the culprit about their intentions after we catch them."
#Protagonist
"……Yes."
Filled with an indescribable sense of gloom, I let Souko-san lead me by the hand as we left Ai-san's room.
