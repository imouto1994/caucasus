After resting my body and mind for a while, I decided to take action once more to find clues.
Stepping out into the corridor, I saw Dr. Mikanagi walking toward me.
＃Mikanagi
「Hey there.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Dr. Mikanagi...」
＃Mikanagi
「...It doesn't seem to be resolving very quickly.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... someone from the foot of the mountain should be coming tomorrow, but I don't think we’ll make it through without something else happening.」
＃Mikanagi
「True. Once the police arrive, I’m sure many things will come to light. There’s a lot of uncertainty in my examinations, after all.」
＃Protagonist
「...Whatever the culprit's goal is, I think tonight is the climax.」
＃Mikanagi
「...I agree. I’d like everyone to stay in their rooms if possible, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Narumi
「Wait! It’s terrible!」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Narumi-san?」
Narumi-san came running from the atrium.
＃Mikanagi
「Is something wrong?」
＃Narumi
「Everything’s wrong... Kirihara-san’s room is...!」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Souko-san...? What happened!?」
＃Narumi
「Just come with me!」
Narumi-san grabbed my arm and pulled me along.
Souko-san... what on earth happened...?
