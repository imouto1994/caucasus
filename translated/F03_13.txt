I’ve come to the chapel at the far end of the first floor.
The wedding ceremony that was held here since last night... in the end, it never reached a proper conclusion...
There's no point in drowning in sentimentality.
I'll head somewhere else.
I’ve come to the chapel at the far end of the first floor.
I place my hand on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Ah...」
It's open.
I peek inside.
In the deathly silent chapel, there seems to be no one.
＃Akane
「Lady Ai... she isn't here.」
＃Protagonist
「No...」
Just in case, I also checked the coffin where Shion-san had been sleeping until this morning, but it was empty.
＃Akane
「...Let's look elsewhere.」
Prompted by Akane-san, who seemed somewhat dejected, I left the chapel.
