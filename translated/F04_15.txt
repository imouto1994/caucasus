I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... feeling a bit nervous, I knock on the door.

「Huh... I guess he's not in.」
Even after waiting, there was no response.
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.

「Huh... I guess he's not in.」
Even after waiting, there was no response.
Without thinking, I placed my hand on the doorknob.
＃Protagonist
「Whoa...」
The door opened.
What should I do...?
Go inside
Don't go inside
I softly closed the door.
There's no way I could pull a stunt like some thief.
Besides, if Takamine-san came back while I was inside... just thinking about it is terrifying.
After making sure no one saw me open the door, I quietly moved away from the front of Takamine-san's room.
I looked both ways down the corridor, and after confirming no one was watching, I slipped inside the room.
The room was pitch black as well.
I waited a bit for my eyes to adjust, then looked around the room.
Now then, what should I do...?
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door, but there's no response.
He must not have returned yet.
The door probably isn't locked, but I don't want to do anything like sneaking in.
I softly moved away from the front of Takamine-san's room.
