"...There's a high probability Rokuyou-san was killed at that time."
#Satoshi
"...Yeah."
#Maya
"...Was Isamu-san killed around then...?"
#Satoshi
"It's possible."
#Ai
"Isamu-san was killed in the middle of the night, wasn't he..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Benio
"...It was late at night. If Rokuyou was killed then, most people wouldn't have an alibi..."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"...If only I had taken your concerns seriously and checked properly back then, maybe we wouldn't be in such a state of chaos..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe, but..."
#Takamine
"...The walls here are thick. You wouldn't hear much from across the corridor anyway."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"...Yours was likely the only room where it could be heard. Isamu's room was directly below yours, after all."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"...But why did the killer cut off his head? Even at the cost of making such a loud noise..."
#Satoshi
"Good question..."
#Narumi
"To think that sound was from when his head was cut off..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
