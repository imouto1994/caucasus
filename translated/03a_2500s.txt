"Understood."
Narumi-san inserted a knife into the piano key I pointed to.
I wonder...

The white part of the piano key cracked.
＃Protagonist
"How is it...?"
＃Narumi
"...This is just a regular piano key."
The wood core was visible from where the surface of the key had peeled off.
＃Protagonist
"I guess this wasn't the place..."
＃Benio
"—What do you think you're doing?"
Benio-san's voice came from behind us.
＃Narumi
"B-Benio-ojousama..."
＃Benio
"...I believe the doctor told you not to do anything reckless?"
＃Protagonist
"Um... well, this is..."
＃Benio
"Don't make excuses, you idiot. You even broke the piano... this was one of Father's keepsakes, you know?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm sorry..."
I should probably stop this.
I really thought we were close to finding something...
＃Narumi
"...We'll just have to give up on this for now."
＃Protagonist
"Then... I'm going to go check on Shion-san."
＃Narumi
"Shion-ojousama? Did you think of something?"
＃Protagonist
"Just a little... I don't have any proof, though."
＃Narumi
"...I see. Be careful."
＃Protagonist
"...Right."
The white part of the piano key cracked.
＃Narumi
"Ah..."
＃Protagonist
"Did you find something?"
＃Narumi
"Wait a second... it's hollow inside."
＃Protagonist
"Did we... hit the jackpot?"
＃Narumi
"...It would seem so."
Narumi-san picked up a small key wrapped in cotton.
＃Protagonist
"...Let's head back. I don't want to linger here too long."
＃Narumi
"Right... but first, we have to clean this up."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
Benio-san is going to be furious when she sees the broken piano key... I'll have to apologize properly later.
After cleaning up the fragments as discreetly as possible, we left the performance room.
