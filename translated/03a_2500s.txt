"Understood."
Narumi-san inserted a knife into the piano key I pointed to.
I wonder...

The white part of the piano key cracked.
#Main Character
"How is it...?"
#Narumi
"...This is just a regular piano key."
The wood core was visible from where the surface of the key had peeled off.
#Main Character
"I guess this wasn't the place..."
#Benio
"—What do you think you're doing?"
Benio-san's voice came from behind us.
#Narumi
"B-Benio-ojousama..."
#Benio
"...I believe the doctor told you not to do anything reckless?"
#Main Character
"Um... well, this is..."
#Benio
"Don't make excuses, you idiot. You even broke the piano... this was one of Father's keepsakes, you know?"
#Main Character
"I'm sorry..."
I should probably stop this.
I really thought we were close to finding something...
#Narumi
"...We'll just have to give up on this for now."
#Main Character
"Then... I'm going to go check on Shion-san."
#Narumi
"Shion-ojousama? Did you think of something?"
#Main Character
"Just a little... I don't have any proof, though."
#Narumi
"...I see. Be careful."
#Main Character
"...Right."
The white part of the piano key cracked.
#Narumi
"Ah..."
#Main Character
"Did you find something?"
#Narumi
"Wait a second... it's hollow inside."
#Main Character
"Did we... hit the jackpot?"
#Narumi
"...It would seem so."
Narumi-san picked up a small key wrapped in cotton.
#Main Character
"...Let's head back. I don't want to linger here too long."
#Narumi
"Right... but first, we have to clean this up."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
Benio-san is going to be furious when she sees the broken piano key... I'll have to apologize properly later.
After cleaning up the fragments as discreetly as possible, we left the performance room.
