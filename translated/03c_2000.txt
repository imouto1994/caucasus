When we arrived in front of the kitchen, there was indeed a burnt smell drifting in the air.
#Takamine
"What is burning?"
#Tsujimura
"I don't know..."
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, please open the door."
The kitchen door was locked.
#Tsujimura
"The key... you say. I don't recall locking it, but..."
While saying so, Tsujimura-san took out the key.
#Protagonist
"Wasn't it you, Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes... wait, that's strange..."
#Protagonist
"What's wrong?"
#Tsujimura
"The key won't turn. This should be the right one..."
#Takamine
"Was the keyhole tampered with?"
Takamine-san peered into the keyhole.
#Takamine
"...It looks like something has been stuffed inside."
#Protagonist
"...Narumi-san."
I whispered into Narumi-san's ear in a low voice.
#Narumi
"What?"
#Protagonist
"Did you see inside the kitchen?"
#Narumi
"No... I haven't checked it."
#Protagonist
"Can you open it?"
#Narumi
"I think it's impossible."
#Takamine
"...It looks like we'll have to force it open."
#Tsujimura
"...I will go fetch some tools."
Tsujimura-san left the corridor.
#Takamine
"However, this smell... is it meat?"
Takamine-san's nose twitched.
#Protagonist
"Meat... no way!?"
I put my hand on the closed kitchen door.
The smell drifting from the gaps.
The thing being roasted on the other side is—
#Protagonist
"Guh... dammit...!"
I slid my fingers into the gap and tried to pry the door open, but it wouldn't budge.
#Takamine
"Calm down."
Takamine-san grabbed my shoulder.
#Protagonist
"But... this is the only place we haven't checked yet...!"
#Takamine
"I know. Just wait a little longer."
I was forcibly pulled away from the door.
#Narumi
"Pull yourself together."
#Protagonist
"...I know."
I knew, but still...
#Tsujimura
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
Tsujimura-san returned with a large crowbar.
#Benio
"Is there a fire?"
Benio-san came along as well.
#Takamine
"Let me use that."
Takamine-san took it and wedged it into the gap of the door.
#Takamine
"Guh... nnh..."
The door creaked.
#Takamine
"Phew..."
Takamine-san let out a deep breath and forced the door open.
A stifling, heavy stench flooded out.
I was the first to dive into the kitchen.
#Protagonist
"Ugh..."
The room was thick with clouds of smoke.
The source was... it seemed to be the oven.
Smoke was seeping out from the gaps of the iron door.
#Protagonist
"Is it in here—"
Benio-san grabbed my reaching arm.
#Benio
"Are you an idiot!? You'll get burned!"
#Protagonist
"But... even so..."
I have to check inside immediately...
#Tsujimura
"Please use this."
Tsujimura-san handed over the crowbar he had used to open the door.
#Protagonist
"Ngh...!"
I unlatched the fastening on the door.
The door opened.
...This time, I knew for certain.
It was unmistakably the smell of burning flesh.
#Takamine
"...Pull it out."
Takamine-san's voice sounded like he was suppressing his emotions.
Using the crowbar I held, I hooked the tray that had been placed at the bottom of the oven.
Along with the smoke and stench, the thing that emerged from the oven was.
#Protagonist
"Eh..."
I was speechless.
#Takamine
"...Tsujimura-san, go call Dr. Mikanagi."
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes!"
Tsujimura-san dashed away.
I wanted to run away too.
#Benio
"Ngh..."
Both Benio-san and Narumi-san turned their faces away.
But... just who on earth was this headless corpse lying before our eyes...?
