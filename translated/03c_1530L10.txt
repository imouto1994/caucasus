Everyone was gathered in the main hall.
Except... Ai-san and Rokuyou-san weren't there.
Except... Rokuyou-san wasn't there.
Benio-san and Dr. Mikanagi were in the clinic.

"Where is Akane-san...?"

"Eh...?"
At her words, I looked around the room.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, where is Akane-san...?"
#Narumi
"Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her since we left the basement..."
#Main Character
"Don't tell me..."
#Souko
"It’s forbidden to jump to conclusions. For now... let’s listen to what the others have to say."
Akane-san had gone missing as well.
#Main Character
"We should ask about everyone's movements after 2:00, right?"
I checked with Souko-san just in case.
#Souko
"Right... but we already confirmed everyone's location, didn't we? Everyone was in their rooms or scattered about, so it might not mean much."
#Main Character
"Still, it's better than not asking at all. I'll need to ask Benio-san for details later anyway."
#Souko
"True. Let's ask if they noticed anything unusual too."
