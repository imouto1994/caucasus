Everyone was gathered in the main hall.
Except... Ai-san and Rokuyou-san weren't there.
Except... Rokuyou-san wasn't there.
Benio-san and Dr. Mikanagi were in the clinic.
Ideally, I should ask Benio-san directly, but that can wait.
＃Souko
「Where is Akane-san...?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
At her words, I looked around the room.
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, where is Akane-san...?」
＃Narumi
「Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her since we left the basement...」
＃Protagonist
「Don't tell me...」
＃Souko
「It’s forbidden to jump to conclusions. For now... let’s listen to what the others have to say.」
Akane-san had gone missing as well.
＃Protagonist
「We should ask about everyone's movements after 2:00, right?」
I checked with Souko-san just in case.
＃Souko
「Right... but we already confirmed everyone's location, didn't we? Everyone was in their rooms or scattered about, so it might not mean much.」
＃Protagonist
「Still, it's better than not asking at all. I'll need to ask Benio-san for details later anyway.」
＃Souko
「True. Let's ask if they noticed anything unusual too.」
