「The lid of the coffin in the chapel is heavy, so it doesn't look like a girl could open it alone.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」

＃Protagonist
「I see...」

＃Shion
「The chapel... I hate the idea of spending any more time there.」

「The chapel is locked. It likely won't be used again for a while.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「Don't go wandering in and out of places where you have no business.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「I hear the chapel isn't used normally.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so?」

＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「A chapel that's only used for weddings is quite a luxury, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
