Is this... an organ?
I can't really tell the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it's clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play a few notes, but it's probably not good to touch it without permission.
It seems to be an organ.
A musical score is placed on the desk.
It appears to be something Kousei-san was writing.
I don't really know, but it might be something valuable.
The title is... "Three Fragments," maybe?
It seems to be a piece titled "Three Fragments."
It looks like musical scores are stored inside the glass cabinet.
Scores by composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach, are lined up.
Many scores are stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san probably used it.
I've already searched here, so I'll look elsewhere.
Musical scores are pasted on the wall.
They were likely composed by Kousei-san.
Musical scores are pasted on the wall.
It's pure white outside; I can't see a thing.
When it's blizzardy like this, even the darkness of night feels bright.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.
A book has been left sitting on the music stand.
It makes it feel as though Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer was a piece of blank staff paper.
A small piece of wood is placed on top as a paperweight.
I'm curious about it, but I can't really take it for no reason...
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It's a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.
