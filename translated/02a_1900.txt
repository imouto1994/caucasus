"Excuse me."
When I entered the office, Tsujimura-san was sitting in a chair, staring blankly into space.
#Protagonist
"Um... Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"A-Ah... it was you. Is something the matter?"
Tsujimura-san immediately straightened his posture and asked.
#Protagonist
"I just thought I'd go check on Shion-san as well. ...Did something happen, Tsujimura-san?"
#Tsujimura
"No... so many things have happened that my mind is feeling a bit cluttered."
#Protagonist
"That... goes for me too. I think everyone is feeling that way."
#Tsujimura
"...My apologies. For things to turn out like this..."
#Protagonist
"It's not your fault, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"However... with Mr. Rokuyou murdered and Miss Ai attacked... as the one responsible for managing this manor, I feel terribly sorry..."
Tsujimura-san looked down.
He looked so small.
#Tsujimura
"...In the past, something similar happened."
#Protagonist
"Something similar...!?"
#Tsujimura
"No, naturally nobody died. However... because of my own incompetence, I once caused a great deal of trouble for the Madam and the others..."
At Tsujimura-san's confession, I felt a slight sense of relief.
I couldn't bear it if things like this happened all the time.
#Tsujimura
"Even now, I find myself thinking about it. I wonder if there was something more I could have done back then. It might be far too late for regrets now, though."
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san..."
#Tsujimura
"I'm begging you. Even if it's only while you're here... could you please protect the young lady, Shion-ojousama...?"
#Protagonist
"Well... of course. I want to protect everyone."
#Tsujimura
"Ah... thank you very much."
Tsujimura-san bowed deeply.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san is safe, isn't she?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, of course. She is in her own room right now."
#Protagonist
"I'll go check on her for a bit."
#Tsujimura
"Understood. I'm counting on you."
