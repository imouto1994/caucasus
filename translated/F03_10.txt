I’ve come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she isn't here.
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Akane-san's room.
＃Akane
"Um... do you have some kind of business?"
＃Protagonist
"I thought Ai-san might be inside, for all we know."
＃Akane
"I don't think that's likely, but..."
While saying so, Akane-san took out her key.
＃Akane
"See, she isn't here."
＃Protagonist
"...You're right."
I suppose that's only natural since Akane-san had the key.
＃Akane
"Let's not lounge around here; let's go search elsewhere."
＃Protagonist
"Understood."
I followed Akane-san out of the room.
