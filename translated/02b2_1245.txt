Shion-san was in the hall.
＃Shion
"Ah..."
She stood up from the sofa upon seeing me.
＃Shion
"Um... has Ai-oneesama been found?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh...?"
Ai-san is missing...?
＃Shion
"...It seemed as though Akane-san was looking for her earlier... and I grew quite frightened..."
Shion-san trembled.
＃Protagonist
"She... hasn't been found yet."
＃Shion
"Is that so... I'm feeling quite scared..."
Shion-san trembled.
＃Protagonist
"It'll be alright, so please don't worry."
I offered words that could easily be taken as empty consolation.
Even if she thought so, I wanted to ease her anxiety even just a little bit.
＃Shion
"I... I'm going back to my room."
Shion-san murmured with her head down.
＃Protagonist
"I'll walk you there."
Without thinking, those words slipped out.
＃Shion
"Eh...?"
＃Protagonist
"I think it's better if you don't move around alone. ...I don't have any proof, but."
＃Shion
"But..."
＃Protagonist
"It'd be better if Tsujimura-san were here... at least as far as the office. It's right nearby, though."
＃Shion
"Then... please do."
Shion-san gave a small nod.
Tsujimura-san was not in the office.
＃Shion
"Um... this far is enough. It's cold outside, so..."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so...?"
＃Shion
"Um... thank you very much."
Shion-san bowed.
＃Protagonist
"We don't know what might happen, so please make sure to lock your door firmly."
＃Shion
"...Yes. Well then."
Shion-san opened the back door.
It seemed as though the snow was still falling.
I...
Follow her.
Return to the hall.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san!"
I called out to Shion-san as she turned her back.
＃Shion
"Yes...?"
＃Protagonist
"Um, I'll walk you to the tower after all."
＃Shion
"B-But..."
Shion-san looked outside.
＃Shion
"...Well then, please do."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah."
I stepped outside first so Shion-san wouldn't be hit by the wind.
＃Protagonist
"Are you alright?"
I called out to Shion-san behind me.
＃Shion
"Yes, I'm used to it."
For all she said that, she was huddling up against the cold.
When we arrived at the entrance to the tower, Shion-san opened the door just as it was.
＃Protagonist
"Don't you keep it locked?"
＃Shion
"...No, not particularly."
＃Protagonist
"...I think it'd be better if you kept it locked from now on."
＃Shion
"I wonder... if so."
Shion-san tilted her head.
＃Protagonist
"Because we don't know what might happen yet."
The culprit who killed Rokuyou-san is still in the manor, after all.
Although I avoided such direct words, Shion-san shrank back anxiously.
＃Shion
"...Please, come in."
Shion-san closed the door.
The heating must be working; it was faintly warm inside.
＃Protagonist
"By the way, is your headache alright now?"
＃Shion
"...It's a regular thing, so there's no need for worry."
＃Protagonist
"I see... take care."
＃Shion
"Yes, thank you very much."
Shion-san headed toward the stairs.
I felt hesitant to accompany her any further.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san"
＃Shion
"Yes...?"
She turned back as she set foot on the stairs.
＃Protagonist
"I'll be going now. ...See you later."
＃Shion
"...Yes."
I stepped outside.
Two sets of footprints remained on the narrow path.
My footprints from my return journey were being left behind me.
The snow is still falling.
These footprints will surely disappear eventually.
Snow is piled up on both sides of the path, making it look as though it'd be impossible to go anywhere else.
I decided to hurry back to the Great Hall.
＃Shion
"...Thank you very much. But... I think I'll stay here after all..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"Well then... see you later."
Shion-san left.
It can't be helped; I'll return to the hall.
＃Protagonist
"Well then... see you."
＃Shion
"...Yes."
Shion-san left.
I'll return to the hall too.
