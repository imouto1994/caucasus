"That's the room Mr. Kousei used. I'm curious, but if we can't enter, it can't be helped."
＃Protagonist
"You're right."
＃Maya
"It is the room my husband used during his lifetime. I have left it exactly as it was."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"My father's room is off-limits. Even I have hardly ever entered it."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"Is it my father's room...? I don't know it well..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"It is the room the master used previously, but it is locked now. I manage the key."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Takamine
"No one is allowed into Mr. Kousei's room. It is a place that has nothing to do with you."
＃Protagonist
"T-That's true..."
＃Mikanagi
"I don't know much about that room myself. It was apparently the previous head's room... but I don't think you can see the inside."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Narumi
"They say that room is preserved exactly as it was when the master was alive... but I don't think there's anything unusual in there."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
