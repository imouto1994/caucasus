"Ai-san, huh…? She was in her room, wasn't she? It seems like a bit of a stretch to make her the culprit in Mikanagi-sensei’s murder."
#Satoshi
"You’re right…"
#Maya
"I wouldn't know, I was resting in my room as well."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Ai
"I was in my room the whole time…"
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Tsujimura
"I believe she was in her room… but I haven't confirmed it."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Takamine
"I wouldn’t know what was happening outside my room."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Akane
"Perhaps she was in her room…?"
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"…At the very least, Lady Ai didn’t leave her room while I was out here in the hallway."
#Satoshi
"…I see."
