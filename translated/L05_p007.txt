"Takamine-san, huh... Honestly, I don't really know. He seems to be in his room the whole time."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"Takamine doesn't seem to have left his room much. Likely out of caution for his surroundings... but it doesn't leave a very pleasant impression."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Tsujimura
"Master Takamine? I haven't seen him speaking much with anyone else since Master Rokuyou passed away..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I've been in my room since I returned just before eleven. I don't believe anything happened."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Master Takamine? I believe he was likely in his room the entire time."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"If it's Takamine-san, I'd bet he was in his room. I don't think he's even shown his face in the dining hall."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
