"Akane-san, huh... The possibility is likely low, but you never know if someone had some kind of leverage over her."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Maya
"Akane... took care of Isamu-san while he was here. Inevitably, I imagine they spent a fair amount of time together..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"Akane-san? I don't see any particular problem there..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"Akane and Rokuyou were often together. But I think it's premature to label her the killer based solely on that..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"Akane-san... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"...Actually, Master Rokuyou specifically requested Mistress Hiyama to attend to his personal needs..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I don't think there was much contact between Rokuyou-kun and her. Though Hiyama-kun likely did attend to his needs."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Mikanagi
"...Isamu never spoke to me about Akane-san. Although he did mention she was looking after him."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Me...? I haven't seen Master Rokuyou since the ceremony..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Narumi
"As for Akane, she returned to our room with me after the ceremony yesterday."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
