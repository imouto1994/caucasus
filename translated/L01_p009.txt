"Akane-san, huh... The possibility is likely low, but you never know if someone had some kind of leverage over her."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Maya
"Akane... took care of Isamu-san while he was here. Inevitably, I imagine they spent a fair amount of time together..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Akane-san? I don't see any particular problem there..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"Akane and Rokuyou were often together. But I think it's premature to label her the killer based solely on that..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"Akane-san... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"...Actually, Master Rokuyou specifically requested Mistress Hiyama to attend to his personal needs..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I don't think there was much contact between Rokuyou-kun and her. Though Hiyama-kun likely did attend to his needs."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"...Isamu never spoke to me about Akane-san. Although he did mention she was looking after him."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Me...? I haven't seen Master Rokuyou since the ceremony..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"As for Akane, she returned to our room with me after the ceremony yesterday."
#Satoshi
"I see."
