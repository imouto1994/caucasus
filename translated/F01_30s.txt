The fire in the fireplace is flickering.
Thanks to that, the room is warm.
If this wasn't here... I shudder to think.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the one leading to the corridor.
I wonder if it connects to the room next door...
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
I definitely saw something like a tower outside the window earlier.
Let's see what's out there once more.
I wiped the fog off the window and leaned closer.
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
I can hear something.
A beautiful sound, distinct from the howling wind of the blizzard.
＃Protagonist
「A song...?」
It's someone's singing voice.
Is that—coming from the tower?
I'm a little curious...
That singing voice from earlier... I'm curious about it...
A painting is displayed on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
I've already searched here, so I'll look elsewhere.
My bed for tonight.
Maybe because I rested a bit earlier, the sheets are wrinkled.
It was soft and very comfortable to sleep in.
There's still time until the wedding, so maybe I could go back to sleep for a bit...
I guess I could rest if I wanted to...
An old-fashioned, antique-style chest of drawers is placed here.
It seems nothing is inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing inside.
It's my bag.
It has plenty of spare clothes inside.
Since I never know when I'll be able to go home when Souko-san drags me along, I always bring extra.
Other than that, I just have a notebook and writing materials.
Oh right, I was going to fix the metal fitting on my bag.
I lightly crush the bag's clasp with the pliers I borrowed from the storage room.
The pliers seem quite loose, like they're about to break any moment.
＃Protagonist
「Ah...」
A small knife tumbled out of my bag's pocket.
Oh right, I had put it in here...
It's not like I have a specific use for it, but I'll hold onto it just in case.
I don't need anything for now.
