The fire in the fireplace is flickering.
Thanks to that, the room is warm.
If it weren't for this... I shudder to think.
The room is warm thanks to the fireplace.
There's a door on a different wall from the corridor side.
It seems to connect to the next room.
It looks like a door connecting to the adjacent room.
ItÅfs pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
A painting is on display on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
IÅfve already checked this spot; let's look elsewhere.
This is the bed I slept in.
It was soft and I slept very well.
I just woke up, so I'm not particularly sleepy...
If you want to rest, I think it's fine to do so...
An old-fashioned, antique-style chest of drawers is here.
It seems nothing is inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing in it.
It's my bag.
It has quite a few changes of clothes inside.
When IÅfm with Souko-san, I never know when I'll be able to go home, so I always bring plenty.
Other than that, I just have my notebook and writing utensils.
I don't need anything from it at the moment.
