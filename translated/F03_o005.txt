"So that was Shion-san's room... She's made to live in the annex all by herself."
#Protagonist
"Yes..."
#Maya
"That is the room of my youngest daughter, Shion. She is of delicate health, so we have her live in the annex."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"The only way to get to the tower is through the door in the back of the office."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Shion
"...It is my room."
#Protagonist
"...That's right."
#Tsujimura
"With this snow, I must do some shoveling. It would be a serious matter if Lady Shion were to fall."
#Protagonist
"That's true."
#Takamine
"...I heard Shion-kun has lived in that tower since a long time ago."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Mikanagi
"Shion-san is of delicate health, so she lives in the annex... my father might have given those instructions..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Only Lady Shion lives in the annex... It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
