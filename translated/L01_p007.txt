"Takamine-san, huh... I don't see any particular reason for him to kill Rokuyou-san. Don't judge him just by his looks."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"Attorney Takamine and Isamu-san weren't exactly close. They may have spoken regarding the ceremony and such, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Takamine-san took over the role of the Nanatsuki family's legal counsel from his father. I believe he's someone who sees things very clearly."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"In Takamine's case, you notice that face before you even think about a crime. That doesn't mean I'm prepared to say he's not the killer, though."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Shion
"Master Takamine... I'm sorry. I... don't know him well."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"I don't think there was anything in particular between Master Takamine and Master Rokuyou..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"Last night I went straight to my room and slept. I'm a heavy sleeper, so I wouldn't know what was happening outside."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Takamine-san is a lawyer specifically for the Nanatsuki family. He couldn't be stationed here if he were working elsewhere."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"Master Takamine's room is opposite Master Rokuyou's... but the soundproofing is good, so I doubt he heard a thing."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"Takamine-san? He's a bit shady, but I guess he's still a lawyer."
#Satoshi
"I... I see."
