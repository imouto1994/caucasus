「Takamine-san, huh... I don't see any particular reason for him to kill Rokuyou-san. Don't judge him just by his looks.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Maya
「Attorney Takamine and Isamu-san weren't exactly close. They may have spoken regarding the ceremony and such, but...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Ai
「Takamine-san took over the role of the Nanatsuki family's legal counsel from his father. I believe he's someone who sees things very clearly.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「In Takamine's case, you notice that face before you even think about a crime. That doesn't mean I'm prepared to say he's not the killer, though.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Shion
「Master Takamine... I'm sorry. I... don't know him well.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「I don't think there was anything in particular between Master Takamine and Master Rokuyou...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「Last night I went straight to my room and slept. I'm a heavy sleeper, so I wouldn't know what was happening outside.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「Takamine-san is a lawyer specifically for the Nanatsuki family. He couldn't be stationed here if he were working elsewhere.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Akane
「Master Takamine's room is opposite Master Rokuyou's... but the soundproofing is good, so I doubt he heard a thing.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「Takamine-san? He's a bit shady, but I guess he's still a lawyer.」
＃Protagonist
「I... I see.」
