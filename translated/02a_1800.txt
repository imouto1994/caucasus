It turned six o'clock, so I headed back to the hall for the time being.
The interior of the manor was as dark as ever.
It was getting to the point where walking around without a light would be difficult.
#Benio
"It's certainly gotten dark."
Benio-san was in the hall.
#Satoshi
"It really has..."
#Benio
"Are the preparations to fix the generator ready?"
In response to Benio-san's question, I showed her the toolbox I’d brought from the storage room.
#Satoshi
"Yes, I found the fuses, so I think it'll be fine. We need to get the lights back on as soon as possible, after all."
#Benio
"Are the preparations to fix the generator ready?"
#Satoshi
"Ah... w-well... I couldn't find the fuses."
#Benio
"...I see."
Benio-san held out a toolbox to me.
#Satoshi
"I-I'm sorry... but I'm not sure if I can actually do it..."
#Benio
"That reminds me, Tsujimura said he wanted to ask you to repair the generator."
#Satoshi
"Eh, me?"
#Benio
"I'm a complete amateur when it comes to machinery. Surely you can handle it?"
Saying so, Benio-san handed the toolbox over to me.
#Satoshi
"Umm, I'm not sure if I can, but..."
#Benio
"It's just replacing a fuse or something, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"...I'll do my best. I'm certainly starting to miss the light by now."
Even though it had only been about thirty minutes, it felt like a very long time.
#Benio
"If it stays dark even after night falls, the danger will only increase."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
Souko-san came down from the second floor.
#Souko
"Is it finally getting fixed?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, I have all the tools ready."
#Souko
"...Are you the one fixing it?"
Souko-san furrowed her brow.
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's the plan?"
#Souko
"Do you even know how to fix it?"
#Satoshi
"...Probably."
#Benio
"I haven't the slightest clue."
For some reason, Benio-san declared that with her chest puffed out.
#Souko
"...I'll go with you. I couldn't bear it if you ended up breaking it completely."
Souko-san let out a massive sigh.
We passed through the door at the bottom of the hall's stairs and headed down.
The basement was pitch black.
Our only reliance was the small beam from the flashlight illuminating the way ahead.
The light hit a large piece of machinery.
#Satoshi
"This is it."
#Souko
"First, check if the main power is turned off. Otherwise, you'll get electrocuted."
Having Souko-san point that out from behind me, I looked all over the machine.
I found a large lever.
The lever was flipped toward the side labeled "OFF."
#Souko
"It looks like it's already been shut off."
#Satoshi
"Then, all that's left... is to put this fuse in, right?"
#Souko
"The blown fuse should still be in there, so remove that first."
#Satoshi
"Understood."
I opened the white ceramic fuse box.
A fragment of a fuse that had been melted by heat was held in place by screws.
#Souko
"By the way... do you know what caused the blackout in the first place?"
Souko-san asked Benio-san.
#Benio
"Apparently, a fuse just blew. Tsujimura said that someone was likely using too much electricity somewhere."
#Souko
"I see..."
#Benio
"Fix it quickly. I can't stand this darkness."
#Satoshi
"I know. Now then—"
Using a screwdriver, I removed the fragments of the blown fuse.
I loosened the two screws at the top and bottom and fitted in a new fuse that was about the same thickness as the one that had blown.
#Benio
"...I'm impressed you can actually do something like that."
Benio-san was looking on with admiration.
#Souko
"It's a hassle to call an electrician for something like this, so I usually just do it myself."
#Benio
"We leave everything to Tsujimura, so I can't do a single thing around the house."
#Satoshi
"I think it's better if you can at least do a little bit, though."
Well, I suppose that helplessness is part of being a high-class lady.
I tightened the screws back up and closed the lid of the fuse box just as it was.
#Satoshi
"Now, if I just turn on the main power..."
I flipped the large lever toward "ON."
The lights came on.
Even though it shouldn't have been that bright, I squinted at the glare.
#Satoshi
"Eh—!?"
The lights immediately cut out again.
#Souko
"Again!?"
#Benio
"What happened!?"
Benio-san pressed closer.
#Satoshi
"Eh... what just happened...?"
Faltering, I shut off the main power once more.
Smoke was leaking from the white fuse box.
#Souko
"...Did it blow again...?"
I reached for the lid to check the fuse.
#Satoshi
"Hot!?"
#Souko
"Don't touch it carelessly when smoke is coming out. But... I wonder why."
Souko-san used the tip of the screwdriver to pry the lid open.
A thick cloud of smoke billowed out.
#Souko
"Wait, could it be..."
Souko-san picked up the fragment of the fuse that had been there before.
#Souko
"You put in one that was the same size as this, right?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's right..."
#Souko
"I suspect... including the one that was blown before, they might have been replaced with fuses that have a low ampere rating."
#Benio
"What does that mean?"
#Souko
"It means they'll blow again right away."
#Benio
"I don't quite get it, but isn't there a bigger one?"
#Satoshi
"Umm..."
I looked for a spare fuse.
There was only one that was thicker than the previous one.
#Satoshi
"Ah, I found it. But... what's going on?"
#Souko
"It's likely the work of the culprit. They probably replaced the fuses with ones that are right on the edge of the daytime power consumption, intending for them to blow in the evening when more electricity is used."
#Satoshi
"So you're saying it was a trap. But... what could the culprit's intention be?"
#Souko
"Well... giving everyone around them a sense of anxiety by having the lights go out, or simply making it easier for themselves to move around, I suppose."
#Benio
"In other words, there's a possibility they're on the move right at this moment."
#Souko
"...That might be the case."
#Benio
"I don't quite understand, but is this kind of thing easy to do?"
#Souko
"It wouldn't be difficult for someone with a certain amount of knowledge."
#Benio
"Hmm..."
Benio-san crossed her arms and sank into thought.
#Benio
"...So, since the power just cut out again, does that mean a lot of electricity is still being used somewhere?"
#Souko
"That...!"
Souko-san gasped and grabbed my arm.
I was just about to install the larger fuse and flip the main power switch.
#Satoshi
"Eh...!?"
#Souko
"Wait. There's a possibility of a short circuit somewhere. If we don't investigate that first, the line might just snap again."
#Satoshi
"A short circuit... you mean. Where on earth...?"
#Souko
"I don't know... but let's split up and look for it."
#Satoshi
"But how...?"
#Souko
"A wire might have been chewed on by a rat... or maybe water. If meltwater from the snow is leaking into the attic..."
#Benio
"If it comes to that, we amateurs are helpless... Hmm? Water... how about the bathroom? If it's related to plumbing, that's about the only place I can think of."
#Satoshi
"Anyway, let's go check. It's also necessary to confirm everyone else's safety."
#Souko
"...You're right."
#Benio
"We can finally settle down now."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... but why a blackout at a time like this..."
#Souko
"...It's possible it was a trap set by the culprit."
#Benio
"Mm, I agree."
The two of them looked at each other and nodded.
#Satoshi
"A trap, huh..."
#Souko
"Let's head back for now. It's hard to settle down in such a cramped place."
#Benio
"Once we're back, let's make sure to confirm that everyone is safe."
#Satoshi
"Right."
