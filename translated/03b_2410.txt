I walked over to Narumi-san by the atrium.
＃Protagonist
「What are you doing here?」
＃Narumi
「Just thinking. There’s the code from earlier, but... from here, I can see almost everyone’s movements.」
＃Protagonist
「...True, you can see the entire second-floor corridor from here.」
＃Narumi
「I can see the first-floor hall too, so I can tell when people are moving around...」
＃Protagonist
「It might be a good idea to keep watch here tonight.」
＃Narumi
「...What about the search for the hidden inheritance?」
Narumi-san asked in a low voice.
＃Protagonist
「Dr. Mikanagi just warned me. He said it’s best to stay quiet.」
＃Narumi
「I can see why he’d say that... but this is what I infiltrated this place for.」
＃Protagonist
「Shouldn't you give up? The police will likely be here tomorrow.」
＃Narumi
「But look... I want the inheritance, but I also want to solve the mystery of that code, don't you?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, yes, but...」
I was certainly curious about that mystery.
But with no clues found so far, it would be difficult.
＃Narumi
「If only we knew the meaning of that last word...」
＃Protagonist
「Let's just stop. Right now, let’s just pray there are no more victims.」
＃Narumi
「I suppose... hmm?」
Narumi-san tilted her head as she looked downstairs.
＃Narumi
「Shion-ojousama, is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Shion-san?」
Peering down, I made eye contact with Shion-san, who had just climbed the stairs.
＃Shion
「A... ah.」
Shion-san stopped at the top of the stairs.
＃Protagonist
「Is something wrong?」
＃Shion
「Um... I was going to get some medicine from Dr. Mikanagi...」
＃Protagonist
「Dr. Mikanagi has already returned to his room.」
＃Shion
「Ah... I see...」
She must have been feeling unwell; Shion-san's expression was grim.
＃Protagonist
「Should I go with you?」
＃Shion
「No... I'm fine.」
Shion-san shook her head, bowed, and walked down the corridor.
＃Protagonist
「...It’s no wonder she’s feeling unwell given the situation.」
＃Narumi
「Of course. Even the Madam’s appetite has decreased.」
Narumi-san muttered as she gazed down the western corridor.
Only Maya-san was left on the west side.
...Given that Benio-san had died, it was no wonder.
Only Maya-san and Souko-san were on the west side.
＃Protagonist
「...I just hope nothing else happens.」
＃Narumi
「...If I were the killer, I’d think tonight was the climax and try to make a move. Although if they’ve already achieved their goal, maybe not...」
＃Protagonist
「What do you think the killer's goal is?」
＃Narumi
「Something other than money, surely. If it were truly an inheritance dispute, there’d be no point in killing Rokuyou-san first, and kicking out the competition wouldn't get you the money.」
＃Protagonist
「True... the remaining person would just become the prime suspect...」
＃Narumi
「Exactly. So I think the goal is something other than money—a grudge, or a crime of passion.」
＃Protagonist
「A crime of passion, huh...」
I wondered if there was something more to Rokuyou-san's murder as well.
Since that was where it all began—
＃Narumi
「Eh—Shion-ojousama!?」
Narumi-san cried out as she looked down the northern corridor.
