Souko-san and Tsujimura-san were in the devastated kitchen.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san, how does it look?"
#Souko
"...It seems the explosion was indeed caused intentionally."
Souko-san was holding something that looked like a thin string.
#Protagonist
"What's that...?"
#Souko
"It looks like a lead wire. I found some charred batteries too, so they likely rigged the doorknob so that opening it would trigger a spark."
#Tsujimura
"But, who would do such a thing..."
#Souko
"The culprit, obviously."
Souko-san stated firmly.
#Souko
"No one else would do something like this in a situation like this."
#Protagonist
"But, why would they do this?"
That was the question I just couldn't get out of my head.
#Souko
"Well, clearly to kill someone else—"
Souko-san stopped mid-sentence.
#Protagonist
"It's strange. Setting a trap when you can't be sure who will get caught in it."
#Souko
"You're right... indeed, the target was unspecified... meaning anyone would have done...?"
#Protagonist
"...I wonder."
I might need to investigate that part further.
#Tsujimura
"But... whatever shall we do now...?"
#Souko
"Well... at the very least, it doesn't look like we'll be preparing meals here."
Souko-san tried to open the lid of the kiln but quickly gave up.
#Souko
"This is warped too..."
#Tsujimura
"It might be best to seal this area off for the time being."
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
I decided to leave the kitchen.
Souko-san and Tsujimura-san were still in the kitchen.
#Tsujimura
"Oh, what's the matter?"
#Protagonist
"Have you discovered anything else?"
#Souko
"I'm still in the middle of investigating. If you want to know more, come back after a little more time has passed."
#Protagonist
"Understood."
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
Souko-san was in the kitchen.
#Souko
"Have you come to investigate too?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah, have you found anything out?"
#Souko
"Hmm... mostly that since the amount of accumulated gas was low, the explosion wasn't all that massive."
#Protagonist
"Do you know when the gas started leaking?"
Souko-san shook her head at my question.
#Souko
"I can't say for sure because I don't know how far the gas valve was open or the exact volume at the time of the blast. But I don't think much time had passed."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
Determining the exact time seems impossible.
#Souko
"...Regardless, this leaves a nasty taste in my mouth."
Souko-san muttered under her breath.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san?"
#Souko
"...Fire consumes everything. Even a gas explosion is no different."
#Protagonist
"Right... well, I'll go check some other places."
#Souko
"...Yes, be careful."
Souko-san was still in the kitchen.
#Protagonist
"How is it going?"
#Souko
"...I don't think I'm going to find much else."
Souko-san let out a long breath.
#Souko
"I don't want to stay too long in a place that reeks of soot like this."
#Protagonist
"I suppose not..."
I'll head somewhere else.
I entered the kitchen, but no one was there.
I took a look around, but the place had been left a mess by the explosion.
Souko-san has likely finished her investigation, and I shouldn't go around disturbing the scene...
When I entered the kitchen, Benio-san was looking around the room.
#Protagonist
"Benio-san..."
#Benio
"Oh, it's you."
#Protagonist
"Are you investigating?"
#Benio
"Yeah."
#Protagonist
"I think Souko-san already checked this place earlier..."
#Benio
"There might be something she overlooked, don't you think?"
#Protagonist
"I doubt that would happen with Souko-san..."
#Benio
"...You certainly take her side an awful lot."
#Protagonist
"Eh? You think so?"
#Benio
"You're not even aware of it... well, fine. How do you see this incident?"
#Protagonist
"Me? ...Well, I don't think it was just an accident..."
I stated exactly what I was thinking.
#Benio
"Hmm... and if you believe it wasn't a simple accident, you must have a reason for that, naturally?"
#Protagonist
"I don't have some perfectly plausible reason, but... it's just unthinkable that an accident like this would happen purely by chance."
#Benio
"Most accidents happen by chance, don't they? Though in many cases, there is a human element behind the cause..."
#Protagonist
"Well, explosions don't just happen if nobody does anything."
#Benio
"In other words, someone did this intentionally. But why?"
#Protagonist
"Why... indeed..."
The reason for choosing this location.
Who they were trying to kill in this place.
That was the one thing I simply couldn't understand.
#Benio
"If you intended to kill someone for a purpose, you wouldn't use a method like this. If the victim could have been anyone, it destroys all our previous assumptions."
#Protagonist
"So a thrill-seeker...?"
#Benio
"Or a thrill-killer. I find it hard to believe we have one of those among our lot... well, this is the Nanatsuki family, so I suppose anything is possible."
Benio-san let out a self-deprecating laugh.
#Benio
"...Or perhaps, they didn't intend to kill anyone at all."
#Protagonist
"Eh... it's true that there were only injuries... but then for what purpose?"
#Benio
"That's exactly what I've been asking you."
Benio-san kicked the floor with her heel in irritation.
#Protagonist
"If it wasn't a trap designed to kill someone..."
Then why this place—?
My thoughts were going in circles.
#Benio
"Gah, damn it... there's definitely something here..."
Benio-san kicked the lid of the kiln.
The warped metal rang out with a dull, heavy thud.
Benio-san was still in the kitchen.
#Benio
"Did you find anything?"
#Protagonist
"No, nothing in particular. How about you?"
#Benio
"Same as before. The motive for blowing this place up remains a mystery."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
