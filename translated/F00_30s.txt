I searched the area, but I couldn't find anything resembling a key.
A bright red fire flickers within the hearth.

"Wait... this is impossible."
It's far too hot to investigate.
#Narumi
"I don't think this is the fireplace the code meant, anyway..."
#Protagonist
"If we can't find anything elsewhere, let's come back and check it again later."
#Narumi
"I think that's for the best."
It's simply too hot to even attempt an investigation.
There's a door on a different wall from the hallway side.
It seems to connect to the adjacent room.
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A painting is hanging on the wall.
I don't know the artist, but it's a somewhat melancholy piece.
I've already finished searching here, so let's look elsewhere.
This is the bed I slept in.
It was soft and I slept very well.
I just woke up, so I'm not particularly sleepy...
If you want to rest, I think it's fine to take a break...
There's an old, antique-style chest of drawers here.
It appears to be empty inside.
It's likely for guests; there's nothing inside.
This is my bag.
It's mostly packed with a change of clothes.
When I'm dragged along by Souko-san, I never know when I'll be able to go home, so I always bring extra.
Other than that, there's just my notebook and writing tools.
I don't need anything from it right now.
