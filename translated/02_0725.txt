On my way down to the first floor to find the hall, I spotted Souko-san in the telephone room.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san...?"
She was holding the receiver to her ear, tilting her head.
#Souko
"I thought I’d try calling the university to let them know the situation... but it’s not connecting."
#Protagonist
"What?"
I took the receiver and pressed it to my ear.
There was no sound at all.
#Protagonist
"Do you think the line snapped somewhere?"
#Souko
"Probably... with all this snow."
I put the receiver back.
#Protagonist
"We should probably let someone know, shouldn't we?"
#Souko
"Yeah... Could you go tell Tsujimura-san for me?"
#Protagonist
"Sure, I can do that."
#Souko
"Narumi-san is getting breakfast ready, so she said to come to the dining hall if you want to eat."
#Protagonist
"What about you, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"I don't have much of an appetite in the morning. A cola will be enough for me."
#Protagonist
"...Couldn't you at least say 'coffee' for once?"
#Souko
"What's it to you what I drink in the morning?"
Well, she wasn't wrong, but I still had a hard time wrapping my head around drinking such a sugary liquid first thing in the morning.
#Souko
"Make sure you're at the Great Hall by eight."
#Protagonist
"I know. See you later, Souko-san."
