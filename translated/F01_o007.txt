"A song...? I haven't heard anything, so I wouldn't know."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Maya
"A song? It is likely Shion who is singing."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"That would be Shion singing, I imagine. Her voice is quite beautiful."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"A song... that would likely be Shion, wouldn't it?"
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That would likely be Lady Shion. She often sings to herself."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"You can reach the room where Lady Shion resides through this door at the back of the office."
#Satoshi
"Um, if it's alright, I'd like to go and offer my greetings..."
#Tsujimura
"Yes, I don't mind that, but..."
#Rokuyou
"A song? ...Come to think of it, I feel like I might have heard something."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"A song... someone must be singing."
#Satoshi
"I suppose so."
#Mikanagi
"A song... I believe that would be Shion-san."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"A song? Lady Shion seems to sing quite often, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"The one who sings often would be Lady Shion, I think. Though Lady Benio plays the piano as well."
#Satoshi
"I see."
