I've come to Maya-san's room, located at the far end of the west side on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.

"Oh... is something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"Hello, Maya-san. Has anything unusual happened?"
#Maya
"No... nothing in particular... Is there anything else?"
#Satoshi
"Um, could I have a little bit of your time? Of course, if it's inconvenient, I'll leave immediately..."
#Maya
"It is no problem at all. What might it be?"
With that, Maya-san invited me into the room.
#Maya
"So, what is it you wanted to discuss?"
I've come to Maya-san's room, at the far end of the west side on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
#Maya
"Oh... what might it be this time?"
#Satoshi
"Um, could I have a little bit of your time?"
#Maya
"Yes, that's fine... Please, come inside."
With that, Maya-san invited me into the room.
#Maya
"What might your business be?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
