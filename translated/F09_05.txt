I've arrived at the office, but it looks like Tsujimura-san isn't here.
What should I do...
＃Tsujimura
"Oh... it's you."
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san... has anything unusual happened?"
＃Tsujimura
"No... nothing in particular..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Regarding the matter with Mistress Kirihara's room, I can't really say..."
＃Protagonist
"...I haven't found any clues myself yet."
＃Tsujimura
"...Was there anything else?"
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
＃Tsujimura
"Oh, what is it this time?"
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
