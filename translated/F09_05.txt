I've arrived at the office, but it looks like Tsujimura-san isn't here.
What should I do...
#Tsujimura
"Oh... it's you."
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
#Satoshi
"Tsujimura-san... has anything unusual happened?"
#Tsujimura
"No... nothing in particular..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Regarding the matter with Mistress Kirihara's room, I can't really say..."
#Satoshi
"...I haven't found any clues myself yet."
#Tsujimura
"...Was there anything else?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
#Tsujimura
"Oh, what is it this time?"
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
