"Takamine-san, huh... Honestly, I don't really know. He seems to be in his room the whole time."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"Takamine doesn't seem to have left his room much. Likely out of caution for his surroundings... but it doesn't leave a very pleasant impression."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
＃Tsujimura
"Master Takamine? I haven't seen him speaking much with anyone else since Master Rokuyou passed away..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I've been in my room since I returned just before eleven. I don't believe anything happened."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Master Takamine? I believe he was likely in his room the entire time."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"If it's Takamine-san, I'd bet he was in his room. I don't think he's even shown his face in the dining hall."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
