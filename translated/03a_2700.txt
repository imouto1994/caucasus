I returned to the first floor.
＃Protagonist
"Then I’ll go to Shion-san’s place."
＃Narumi
"Will you be okay on your own?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... don't worry."
I passed through the empty office and stepped outside.
The snow had weakened considerably.
The starlight wasn't visible yet, but the clouds seemed to have thinned out quite a bit.
Soon—everything will be over.
I climbed the tower stairs and stood before Shion-san’s room.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san, it’s me. Are you awake...?"
The door opened from the inside, and Shion-san peered out.
＃Shion
"Um... what is it...?"
＃Protagonist
"I’d like to talk for a moment..."
＃Shion
"...Come in. It must be cold outside."
I was shown into the room.
＃Shion
"Is the talk... about the incident...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, well..."
＃Shion
"I see..."
Shion-san looked down.
＃Shion
"...I suppose bad things cannot be hidden after all..."
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san..."
I haven't yet grasped the decisive evidence for Rokuyou-san’s murder.
Yet... Shion-san is about to confess.
＃Shion
"I... killed Rokuyou-sama."
＃Protagonist
"...I see. But why...?"
＃Shion
"I... cannot answer that."
Shion-san looked down once more.
＃Shion
"It is all... my fault. Even the things I’ve hidden until now... I will accept any punishment. But..."
＃Protagonist
"Can you really not tell me the reason...?"
＃Shion
"I am so sorry... it was the only thing I could do..."
＃Protagonist
"...Ai-san as well...?"
＃Shion
"...Yes."
＃Protagonist
"Why..."
Shion-san did not answer.
＃Protagonist
"...Let’s go."
It seemed there was nothing more I could get out of her.
The rest... I’ll leave to the police.
＃Protagonist
"...I have evidence of Rokuyou-san’s murder."
＃Shion
"—!"
Shion-san gasped.
＃Shion
"And... what do you intend to do with it...?"
＃Protagonist
"I... want to protect you, Shion-san."
＃Shion
"B-But, I...!"
＃Protagonist
"...Of course, sin must be atoned for as sin. But after the purification is over—"
I placed my hands on both of Shion-san’s shoulders.
＃Shion
"—!"
She turned her face away.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san... I—"
＃Shion
"...I am so sorry."
＃Protagonist
"Is it... no good...?"
＃Shion
"I... already have someone I’ve decided on in my heart..."
＃Protagonist
"Eh..."
＃Shion
"I am... so sorry..."
Shion-san lowered her face.
＃Protagonist
"The way you say that... it doesn't seem to be Rokuyou-san..."
Shion-san did not answer.
＃Protagonist
"...Is it Tsujimura-san?"
＃Shion
"Eh—!?"
Shion-san looked at me with an expression of shock.
＃Protagonist
"...It’s something one can realize with a little thought. You, who are so polite, called only Tsujimura-san by the name Seiji-san."
＃Shion
"That is... yes..."
＃Protagonist
"...And so, unable to go through with the marriage to Rokuyou-san at any cost, you killed him."
＃Shion
"That is..."
Shion-san faltered.
＃Protagonist
"...Could you tell me, if possible? What happened that night."
＃Shion
"...Yes, I understand."
Shion-san began to speak slowly, recalling the events of the day before yesterday.
＃Shion
"I was inside the coffin in the chapel. I wonder how much time had passed since the ceremony; suddenly, the lid was opened."
＃Shion
"Rokuyou-sama was there. He knew of the relationship between me and Seiji-san. Even the past that I myself did not know..."
—Was it what was written in Kousei-san’s journal?
＃Protagonist
"Were you threatened...?"
＃Shion
"I... to protect us, I had no other choice... pressed by Rokuyou-sama, I..."
Shion-san toyed with her hair.
＃Protagonist
"...After killing him in the chapel, did you go to Rokuyou-san’s room...?"
＃Shion
"No... I dragged Rokuyou-sama’s unconscious body and went to his room. There... I killed him."
＃Protagonist
"...This may be painful, but just a little more... how exactly did you kill him...?"
＃Shion
"How... do you mean...?"
Shion-san tilted her head.
＃Protagonist
"Um... was he dead before the decapitation, or did he die when the head was severed...?"
＃Shion
"That is... um, I don't think anyone dies before their head is cut off..."
＃Protagonist
"Eh—? What do you mean...?"
＃Shion
"...I mean... doesn't a person only die once their head is decapitated...?"
＃Protagonist
"Th-That... isn't the case, though..."
＃Shion
"Is that... so...?"
Does Shion-san... not even have such basic knowledge...?
No, it’s a problem even before knowledge.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san... was that something you were taught by someone...?"
＃Shion
"...There was no one to teach me things... most of it was knowledge I gained from books..."
＃Protagonist
"And Tsujimura-san...?"
＃Shion
"...Seiji-san also taught me many things, but..."
＃Protagonist
"...He didn't teach you about human death."
＃Shion
"He likely thought I naturally knew... since it’s something common..."
Shion-san looked up.
＃Shion
"...I will go and confess my sins to everyone. That will be the beginning of my atonement..."
＃Protagonist
"...Wait. Um... what about Ai-san...?"
＃Shion
"...You may find it hard to believe, but I did not kill Ai-oneesama."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
This makes it clear.
Someone else killed Ai-san.
I can tell even without taking Shion-san’s words entirely at face value.
For she had absolutely no reason to kill Ai-san.
＃Protagonist
"Then... does the name Kanon ring any bells?"
＃Shion
"Kanon... no, I am not familiar with it..."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
It’s been on my mind since I read Kousei-san’s journal.
I see—if it’s her, she has a reason for revenge.
If so, is the target Maya-san—?
＃Protagonist
"Thank you. Then... let’s go."
＃Shion
"Yes..."
＃Protagonist
"But before Shion-san, we have to find the other person who killed Ai-san. Can I ask for your cooperation...?"
＃Shion
"...If it is something I can do, please command me as you wish."
Shion-san bowed deeply.
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
I took Shion-san’s hand and left her room.
