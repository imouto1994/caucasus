＃Souko
「...She seems quite distressed, doesn't she?」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Souko
「If Ai-san being targeted is related to the inheritance, those left behind would be the most suspicious... but I don't think it's quite that simple.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Maya
「I'm glad Ai survived, but... why must this happen...」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know...」
＃Maya
「Why Ai, too...? Are you saying that child did something wrong...?」
＃Protagonist
「Maya-san...」
＃Ai
「...It feels like I can't shake this exhaustion... It's strange, isn't it? I should be in my own home...」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
＃Benio
「Regarding that attack on my sister... I feel like the method was a bit different from how Rokuyou was handled.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「...I don't think it will end with my sister just being targeted. I'll be next... or someone else will be.」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe so...」
＃Shion
「...I'm truly glad that Lady Ai is safe.」
＃Protagonist
「Me too...」
＃Shion
「Why would someone do this to Lady Ai...?」
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...」
＃Tsujimura
「Lady Ai seems to be quite worn down. It's only natural after what happened, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Tsujimura
「...Why did someone try to kill Lady Ai...?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know...」
＃Takamine
「...At any rate, I'm glad Ai-kun didn't lose her life.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Takamine
「...So even Ai-kun was murdered...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Mikanagi
「Ai-san should be back in her room. Given what happened yesterday, she ought to keep resting for now.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「What could the killer be aiming for...? What's to be gained by killing Isamu and Ai-san...?」
＃Protagonist
「And Benio-san as well...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Akane
「I believe Lady Ai is in her room, but...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「To think even Lady Ai would be murdered... what on earth is happening...?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know...」
＃Narumi
「Lady Ai hasn't been herself since yesterday... though I guess that's to be expected.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Narumi
「The reason Lady Ai died, huh... only the killer knows that.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
