Is this... an organ?
I don't really know the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, itÅfs clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play it for a second, but itÅfs probably not a good idea to touch things without permission.
It appears to be an organ.
There's some sheet music sitting on the desk.
It looks like something Kousei-san was in the middle of writing.
I don't really get it, but maybe itÅfs something valuable.
The title is... 'Three Fragments', maybe?
It seems to be a piece of music titled 'Three Fragments'.
The glass cabinet seems to be filled with sheet music.
Scores from composers even I know, like Beethoven and Bach, are lined up there.
A lot of sheet music is stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san probably used it.
IÅfve already checked here, so let's look somewhere else.
Sheet music is pasted onto the wall.
It was likely composed by Kousei-san.
Sheet music is pasted onto the wall.
Everything outside is white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard is ever going to let up...
The storm outside seems to be getting even more violent.
A book has been left lying on the music stand.
ItÅfs almost as if Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer, I found some blank staff paper.
A small wood fragment is being used as a paperweight.
IÅfm curious about it, but I can't exactly just take it if there's no reason to...
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It looks like a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.
