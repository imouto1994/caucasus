I’ve come to the first-floor restroom.
No one is here.
What should I do...?
#Akane
"Eh... where on earth do you think you're going!?"
#Protagonist
"Where? To the restroom..."
#Akane
"...Fine, I'll wait here, so please hurry up."
#Protagonist
"Y-Yes..."
I went into the restroom, but of course, no one was there.
Naturally, Ai-san wasn't there either.
I finished my business, washed my hands, and left the restroom.
#Protagonist
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
#Akane
"...Well then, let's go search elsewhere."
I followed Akane-san and headed for another location.
