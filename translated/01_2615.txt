In the hall, I decided to ask Tsujimura-san about the noise I'd heard earlier.
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san, did you hear a noise just now?」
＃Tsujimura
「A noise...?」
Tsujimura-san tilted his head.
＃Tsujimura
「No, I didn't notice anything in particular... Could it have been the wind?」
＃Protagonist
「It felt different from the wind, though...」
＃Tsujimura
「If that's the case... it might be the work of the mountain spirits.」
＃Protagonist
「Mountain spirits?」
＃Tsujimura
「Many such legends remain in this area. ...Though, much of it is likely rooted in the history of the Nanatsuki family.」
＃Protagonist
「...The 'Curse of the Seven'?」
＃Tsujimura
「That's what those with wagging tongues seem to call it.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah... my apologies.」
＃Tsujimura
「No, don't worry about it. I think I'll be heading to bed now.」
＃Protagonist
「Right... good night.」
I bowed and watched Tsujimura-san walk away toward the back of the first floor.
There it was again?the 'Curse of the Seven.'
