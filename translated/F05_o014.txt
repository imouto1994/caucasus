"A photo of a foreign maid in Takamine-san's room, huh... I wonder who she is."
＃Protagonist
"Who knows..."
＃Maya
"A foreign maid? ...No, there has never been such a person here."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"A foreigner... I don't recall anyone like that during my time here..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"A foreign maid? No, I've never heard of one... perhaps before I was born..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Shion
"A foreign maid-san...? I haven't heard of one, but..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"A foreigner... there were several in the past, but I couldn't say based on that alone..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Marino...? Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time..."
＃Protagonist
"You know her...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Yes... Lady Marino was the daughter of Lady Riesche, a friend of the Master. When Lady Riesche passed away in Japan, she entrusted her daughter to the Master."
＃Protagonist
"...And that's how she came to work here?"
＃Tsujimura
"At the time, the Madam had no children, so the Master intended to adopt her, but Lady Marino declined."
＃Protagonist
"Something like that happened...? But why would Takamine-san have a photo of her...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Takamine-sama used to stay here when he was brought by his father... perhaps they met then..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Takamine-sama used to stay here when he was brought by his father... perhaps they met then..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"...Did you look at the photo?"
＃Protagonist
"S-Sorry, I didn't mean to..."
＃Takamine
"...She is Marino Riesche, a German. She worked here before the war."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so...? But why do you have her photo, Takamine-san?"
＃Takamine
"...No need to pry."
＃Protagonist
"U-Understood..."
＃Takamine
"...Did you hear about this from Tsujimura-san?"
＃Protagonist
"Y-Yeah... I just got a bit curious... what kind of person was she...?"
＃Takamine
"...She was a woman who sang beautiful songs."
＃Protagonist
"Songs..."
＃Takamine
"I heard her mother was also a famous singer in Germany. Talent seems to be hereditary."
＃Protagonist
"And where is she now...?"
＃Takamine
"...She reportedly vanished about twenty years ago. There’s been no trace of her since."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"...No need to pry."
＃Protagonist
"U-Understood..."
＃Mikanagi
"A foreign maid... I've heard there was one here before the war, but I don't know the details."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Oh... were there foreign people working here too...?"
＃Protagonist
"It seems so..."
＃Narumi
"The photo in the lawyer's room? It's from a long time ago... doesn't seem like a lover or anything."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
