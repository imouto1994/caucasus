"Whew..."
Once we reached the first-floor hall, I let out a long breath.
#Narumi
"That was a disaster, seriously..."
#Main Character
"In any case, we have to stop the culprit before they do anything else. Let’s look around the mansion."
#Narumi
"Ah... h-hey..."
As I was about to start looking around, Narumi-san stopped me.
#Main Character
"What is it?"
#Narumi
"Don't you suspect me? I mean... I'm a thief, you know?"
#Main Character
"You might be a thief, Narumi-san, but you aren't a murderer, are you? Besides, there’d be no point in you being locked in here with me."
If Narumi-san were the culprit... she would have killed me when we were locked in.
#Narumi
"I see..."
#Main Character
"Let's hurry, Narumi-san."
As soon as we stepped into the eastern corridor, we ran into Akane-san, who had just come out of her room.
#Main Character
"Ah, Akane-san..."
#Akane
"Is something wrong? You seem to be in a hurry..."
#Main Character
"No, no particular reason..."
It’s probably best not to tell her we were locked in by someone.
#Main Character
"By the way... Akane-san, is your injury okay now?"
#Akane
"Ah, yes. I can't exactly stay still at a time like this."
With that, Akane-san waved her still-bandaged hand.
#Akane
"Oh, that's right. Kirihara-sama was looking for you."
#Main Character
"Souko-san was?"
I wonder if she was worried since I’d disappeared.
#Akane
"She’s still in the dining room..."
#Main Character
"Souko-san?"
When I peered into the dining room, Souko-san was sitting in a chair, drinking cola.
#Souko
"Ah, there you are. Where have you been?"
#Main Character
"Don't 'where have you been' me. It was a disaster."
I briefly explained to Souko-san that we’d been trapped in the basement.
#Souko
"To think something like that happened..."
#Main Character
"The culprit might have been doing something while we were trapped. I thought I should confirm everyone’s safety first..."
#Souko
"That’s a good idea. Then could you go check on the people on the second floor?"
#Akane
"Ah, I'll go check on Dr. Mikanagi."
With that, Akane-san rushed out of the dining room before we could say anything.
#Main Character
"...Then I’ll go check on Benio-san and the others."
#Souko
"Right, please do. I'll check the first floor."
Souko-san placed her empty cola bottle on the table and stood up.
