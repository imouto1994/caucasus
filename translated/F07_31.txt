"Excuse me."
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's somewhere else.
In that case, there's no point in staying here...
What should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
Instead, Benio-san was lying in bed.
I quietly approach her to see how she's doing.
#Benio
"Nnn..."
She seems to be asleep.
I was worried, but it looks like she's okay.
I decided to leave the infirmary so as not to disturb her.
#Satoshi
"Hello, Mikanagi-sensei."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, what is it?"
#Satoshi
"Um... could I have a moment of your time?"
#Mikanagi
"I don't mind."
Now then, what should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Oh, what is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"Could I have a moment of your time?"
#Mikanagi
"Yes, go ahead."
Now then, what should I do?
#Satoshi
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"What is it?"
#Satoshi
"Where is Benio-san...?"
#Mikanagi
"She's sleeping over there."
Mikanagi-sensei pointed toward the bed.
Benio-san seems to be asleep.
#Satoshi
"Is she going to be all right...?"
#Mikanagi
"There's no need to worry. It doesn't seem like she was hit with that much force."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Didn't you have some business with me?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, no! I shouldn't bother Benio-san while she's resting, so I'll be going now."
#Mikanagi
"I see. Well, talk to you later."
I bowed to Mikanagi-sensei and left the infirmary.
When I peeked into the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei was still there.
#Mikanagi
"Oh...?"
Mikanagi-sensei noticed me and looked up.
#Satoshi
"Um... around when do you think Benio-san will wake up?"
#Mikanagi
"She's just sleeping normally right now, so I think she'll wake up soon."
#Satoshi
"I see. Well, talk to you later."
I bowed and left the infirmary.
