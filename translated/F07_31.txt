＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's somewhere else.
In that case, there's no point in staying here...
What should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
Instead, Benio-san was lying in bed.
I quietly approach her to see how she's doing.
＃Benio
「Nnn...」
She seems to be asleep.
I was worried, but it looks like she's okay.
I decided to leave the infirmary so as not to disturb her.
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Mikanagi-sensei.」
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Um... could I have a moment of your time?」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't mind.」
Now then, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Could I have a moment of your time?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, go ahead.」
Now then, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「What is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Where is Benio-san...?」
＃Mikanagi
「She's sleeping over there.」
Mikanagi-sensei pointed toward the bed.
Benio-san seems to be asleep.
＃Protagonist
「Is she going to be all right...?」
＃Mikanagi
「There's no need to worry. It doesn't seem like she was hit with that much force.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「Didn't you have some business with me?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, no! I shouldn't bother Benio-san while she's resting, so I'll be going now.」
＃Mikanagi
「I see. Well, talk to you later.」
I bowed to Mikanagi-sensei and left the infirmary.
When I peeked into the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei was still there.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh...?」
Mikanagi-sensei noticed me and looked up.
＃Protagonist
「Um... around when do you think Benio-san will wake up?」
＃Mikanagi
「She's just sleeping normally right now, so I think she'll wake up soon.」
＃Protagonist
「I see. Well, talk to you later.」
I bowed and left the infirmary.
