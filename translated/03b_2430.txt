When I turned around, Shion-san was standing still in the middle of the hallway, facing this way.
#Main Character
"Shion-san...!?"
She was stained red.
Her clothes, her hands, everything.
Shion-san showed no reaction.
She just stared at me with a dazed, hollow gaze.
No way—!?
#Main Character
"Excuse me, Shion-san—"
I rushed over, choking on the scent of blood as I peered into Dr. Mikanagi's room.
#Main Character
"—!?"
...Not again.
Why... we were just talking a moment ago.
Dr. Mikanagi's body was lying face-up on the floor.
#Narumi
"Dr. Mikanagi...!?"
Narumi-san gasped as she peered into the room from behind me.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san... please take Shion-san to the clinic."
#Narumi
"Y-Yes..."
#Main Character
"And then... go call Tsujimura-san and the others."
I squeezed those words out from my throat.
How could this happen...
Fresh blood was still overflowing from Dr. Mikanagi's neck.
He must have died just moments ago.
The head was still there.
I hated myself for thinking about this so calmly.
We were at the atrium on the second floor.
From there, the hallway on the second floor was clearly visible—
...The only person who had entered or exited this room was Shion-san.
