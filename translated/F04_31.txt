「Excuse me.」
When I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi was nowhere to be found.
I wonder if he's gone somewhere else.
I don't have anything in particular to do, so I'll head elsewhere.
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi, who was sitting in a chair, looked up.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, it's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Has anything unusual happened?」
＃Mikanagi
「Let's see... only that it's pitch black and I can't even read a book.」
＃Protagonist
「That's... well.」
＃Mikanagi
「I'm joking. For now, only that Maya-san said she was feeling a bit unwell. Also, I’m concerned about Shion-san's health, but there don't seem to be any problems yet.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「I just hope the power is restored soon...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I think it should be fixed soon.」
＃Mikanagi
「I see. Then I suppose I'll just have to bear with it a bit longer.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm going to look around a bit more.」
＃Mikanagi
「Alright, I understand.」
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「No, it's not really a matter of having any business, but...」
＃Mikanagi
「Did you notice anything particularly strange while looking around?」
＃Protagonist
「No, not so far.」
＃Mikanagi
「I just hope everything passes without anything else happening...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I hope so too.」
