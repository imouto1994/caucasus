I left the office and headed for the northern corridor.
A gloomy mood dominated my heart.
If Akane-san really had fled...
No, even if she hadn't, why did she vanish...?
It’s dangerous to bias my thinking at this stage.
I have to keep my thoughts flexible.
I arrived in front of Takamine-san's room.
I'll try asking him something.
＃Protagonist
「Takamine-san, it's me.」
The door opened, and Takamine-san peered out with a suspicious look on his face.
＃Takamine
「What is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san has been missing for a while; do you know anything?」
＃Takamine
「Hiyama-kun...? No, I haven't seen her either...」
＃Protagonist
「...When was the last time you saw Akane-san, Takamine-san?」
＃Takamine
「...Let's see, the last time should have been when I saw her last night.」
＃Protagonist
「...When everyone was gathered, right?」
＃Takamine
「Yeah.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
It seems that, as expected, no one has seen her since today began.
＃Protagonist
「I'm sorry, thank you very much.」
I thanked him and decided to leave.
