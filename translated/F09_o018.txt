"You can't expect me to know if you ask me. You have to ask the people of this house."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"...Something like that did happen... I don't remember much, as it was a long time ago..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"...I believe it was right after I was born... I think Tsujimura-san would know."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Benio
"The cause of Takamine's injury, right? Ask him or Tsujimura."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"Right, of course..."
#Tsujimura
"Did Master Takamine mention it...? That was nearly twenty years ago. A fire broke out in a mountain hut nearby..."
#Satoshi
"Nearby... but that's beyond the suspension bridge, isn't it?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, that's right. A mother and daughter lived in that hut, but despite Master Takamine's efforts, the mother passed away..."
#Satoshi
"...Did the children survive?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes. There were two daughters, and they were rescued despite suffering burns."
#Satoshi
"Two... They were sisters?"
#Tsujimura
"One of them was seriously injured and couldn't be treated here, so we entrusted her to a doctor in town... but the other was raised here."
#Satoshi
"...Wait, that one who stayed... wasn't she an albino?"
#Tsujimura
"...She was a normal child at first. But she gradually became white... perhaps she lacked nutrition..."
#Satoshi
"...You mean Shion-san?"
#Tsujimura
"That is correct... Um, could I ask you to keep this a secret, please...?"
#Satoshi
"...I understand."
#Takamine
"...I have nothing more to say about that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"I heard about the fire from my father. The rescued child's burns were so severe she was taken to a hospital in town, but apparently she suddenly vanished."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"I'm sorry... I don't really know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I don't really know about that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
