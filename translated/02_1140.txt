Having chosen to stay put in my room, I spent the time gazing out the window.
The snow showed no signs of slowing down, blowing fiercely across the landscape.
Even the tower that was supposed to be right nearby was shrouded in white, and I couldn't tell if Shion-san was even still there.
I wondered what was going to happen to us...
There was a knock at the door.
#Protagonist
"Yes?"
Who could it be...?
#???
"Excuse me, it’s Hiyama."
#Protagonist
"Hiyama... Akane-san? Is something wrong?"
I unlocked the door and invited Akane-san inside.
#Protagonist
"Did something happen?"
I asked, noticing the restless, anxious look on her face.
#Akane
"Um... have you seen Ai-ojousama?"
#Protagonist
"Eh... Ai-san?"
#Akane
"She's not in her room..."
#Protagonist
"She was there when everyone gathered earlier, but I haven't seen her since."
#Protagonist
"I... was with Ai-san when we took Shion-san to the infirmary... but I don't know where she went after that."
#Akane
"I see..."
I suddenly had a very bad feeling about this.
Souko-san had mentioned the possibility of more to come.
Surely not—but still...
#Protagonist
"...Let's go look for her."
#Akane
"Y-yes, let's!"
Now that things had come to this, I couldn't just sit still.
If... if Ai-san had been taken by the killer, I had to save her no matter what.
