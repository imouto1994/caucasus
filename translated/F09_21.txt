I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
＃Benio
「Yes... Oh, it's you.」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?」
＃Benio
「I don't mind. Come in.」
Benio-san invited me into her room.
＃Benio
「So, what do you want?」
＃Protagonist
「Uh, well...」
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I knock and wait for a while.
＃Benio
「Who is it... Oh, you again.」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?」
＃Benio
「Well, I don't mind.」
Benio-san invited me into her room.
＃Benio
「So, what do you want?」
Benio-san asks, her posture straightening.
＃Protagonist
「Uh, well...」
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Oh...」
No matter how long I wait, there's no response.
I wonder if she's gone somewhere else.
I decided to move to another location too.
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I don't have any business here anymore, but...
＃Protagonist
「...I'll go somewhere else.」
I offered a silent prayer toward the door for a moment before moving on.
