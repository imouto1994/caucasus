I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Benio
"Yes... Oh, it's you."
#Satoshi
"Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?"
#Benio
"I don't mind. Come in."
Benio-san invited me into her room.
#Benio
"So, what do you want?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I knock and wait for a while.
#Benio
"Who is it... Oh, you again."
#Satoshi
"Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?"
#Benio
"Well, I don't mind."
Benio-san invited me into her room.
#Benio
"So, what do you want?"
Benio-san asks, her posture straightening.
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Satoshi
"Oh..."
No matter how long I wait, there's no response.
I wonder if she's gone somewhere else.
I decided to move to another location too.
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I don't have any business here anymore, but...
#Satoshi
"...I'll go somewhere else."
I offered a silent prayer toward the door for a moment before moving on.
