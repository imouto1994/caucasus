＃Protagonist
「Sorry to keep you waiting.」
I set the plates of fried rice down in front of the four people in the dining room?Souko-san, Benio-san, Akane-san, and Tsujimura-san.
＃Benio
「Did you perform a poison test?」
It seems Benio-san was thinking the exact same thing I was.
＃Protagonist
「I ate some myself before portioning it out.」
＃Benio
「I see. And? How was it?」
＃Protagonist
「It was delicious.」
＃Benio
「...Then there shouldn't be a problem.」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san ate some before portioning it out, too.」
＃Benio
「Hmm... in that case, there shouldn't be any issue at all.」
After making sure Benio-san picked up her spoon, Souko-san and the others began their meal as well.
＃Souko
「...Mm, it really is delicious.」
＃Benio
「Well, her skills are certainly genuine.」
＃Akane
「Though, watching her while she was making it, you'd never imagine it would turn out like this.」
＃Tsujimura
「That's true... I'd like her to handle other tasks as well, but...」
＃Narumi
「...I can hear you, you know.」
Narumi-san emerged from the kitchen.
＃Narumi
「Could you take some food to Madam and Shion-ojousama as well?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, understood.」
I was handed three plates piled with fried rice.
For Maya-san, Shion-san, and Dr. Mikanagi, I assume.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san... is it still impossible for her?」
＃Narumi
「Likely. Also, that lawyer said he didn't want any, so there's no need to feed him.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
First, I'll head to the infirmary to check on Ai-san's condition.
