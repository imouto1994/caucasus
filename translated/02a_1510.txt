"Sorry to keep you waiting."
I set the plates of fried rice down in front of the four people in the dining room—Souko-san, Benio-san, Akane-san, and Tsujimura-san.
#Benio
"Did you perform a poison test?"
It seems Benio-san was thinking the exact same thing I was.
#Satoshi
"I ate some myself before portioning it out."
#Benio
"I see. And? How was it?"
#Satoshi
"It was delicious."
#Benio
"...Then there shouldn't be a problem."
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san ate some before portioning it out, too."
#Benio
"Hmm... in that case, there shouldn't be any issue at all."
After making sure Benio-san picked up her spoon, Souko-san and the others began their meal as well.
#Souko
"...Mm, it really is delicious."
#Benio
"Well, her skills are certainly genuine."
#Akane
"Though, watching her while she was making it, you'd never imagine it would turn out like this."
#Tsujimura
"That's true... I'd like her to handle other tasks as well, but..."
#Narumi
"...I can hear you, you know."
Narumi-san emerged from the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Could you take some food to Madam and Shion-ojousama as well?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, understood."
I was handed three plates piled with fried rice.
For Maya-san, Shion-san, and Dr. Mikanagi, I assume.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san... is it still impossible for her?"
#Narumi
"Likely. Also, that lawyer said he didn't want any, so there's no need to feed him."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
First, I'll head to the infirmary to check on Ai-san's condition.
