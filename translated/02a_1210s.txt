There is a small window designed to let in light.
It doesn't appear to have a lock, but it’s far too small for a person to pass through.
It’s highly unlikely the killer used this as an entry or exit point.

"This is the rope that was around Ai-san’s neck..."
#Souko
"It has wire braided into it... it wouldn't have been easy to cut."

"One end was securely fixed to the wall... while the other end was caught in the clock gears."
It’s a wire-reinforced rope that had been wrapped around Ai-san’s neck.

"I wonder what this rod is for..."
I picked up a piece of wood that had been lying on the floor.
#Souko
"It doesn't look like anything particularly important..."
It’s a piece of wood about a meter in length.
These are the gears that drive the clock.
They are currently stationary.
The gears are not moving.
