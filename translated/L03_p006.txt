"Tsujimura-san, huh... It's true he's well-acquainted with the mansion, but even so... I don't see any reason for him to target Ai-san."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Benio
"...There's no reason for him to target my sister, but Tsujimura is also the one most capable of setting up that situation. Though it's unthinkable, of course."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Tsujimura
"I was in the office the whole time... but Lady Shion did come out of her room around noon."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I wouldn't know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"If it's Tsujimura-san, I believe he was in the office."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Tsujimura-san? Wouldn't he be in the office? He's usually there during the day."
#Satoshi
"I see."
