I’ve arrived at the dining hall.
#Narumi
"Oh, what's up?"
Narumi-san was standing there alone.
#Protagonist
"It's rare to see you in the dining hall, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"Oh really?"
#Protagonist
"I always have the impression that you're cooped up in the kitchen."
#Narumi
"Not really... but well, even if I go somewhere else, there's nothing I can do."
#Protagonist
"...No, you're a maid, you should be doing other work too."
#Narumi
"No way, that's too much trouble."
Narumi-san stated flatly.
#Protagonist
"...Sigh."
#Narumi
"More importantly, didn't you come here because you needed something?"
I’ve arrived at the dining hall again.
#Narumi
"Back again?"
#Protagonist
"Is there a problem with that?"
#Narumi
"If you're hungry, I've got some leftover sandwiches from earlier?"
#Protagonist
"It's not that I'm hungry, specifically..."
#Narumi
"Then what do you want?"
