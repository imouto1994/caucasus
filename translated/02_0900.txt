When we entered the Great Hall, almost everyone was already there.
Shion-san and Narumi-san were missing.
Everyone’s face was clouded with a similar expression.
Maya-san and Ai-san looked particularly haggard.
＃Benio
「That was fast. Did something happen?」
The ever-composed Benio-san asked.
＃Takamine
「The ropes on the suspension bridge were cut and the bridge has been dropped.」
＃Souko
「The bridge...? But didn't you say there was no other way... when we first got here?」
Souko-san looked at Benio-san.
＃Benio
「...I suppose it’s turned out exactly as I said it would, hasn't it?」
Benio-san bit her lip.
＃Ai
「What does that mean...? Hey, what about the police...?」
＃Benio
「...They won't be coming. And we can't call for any other help, either.」
＃Ai
「Then what are we supposed to do!? I can't stay here! Not with someone who killed Isamu-san!!」
＃Benio
「...Sister, please. Calm down.」
Benio-san chided Ai-san, sounding a bit weary.
＃Ai
「But!!」
＃Benio
「...Akane, take my sister to Shion's room.」
＃Akane
「Ah... yes, as you wish.」
Akane-san approached the agitated Ai-san.
＃Akane
「Ai-ojousama, let’s go to Shion-ojousama's room, shall we?」
＃Ai
「Shion's... oh, yes, you're right...」
Mentioning Shion-san seemed to calm Ai-san down.
She obediently followed Akane-san out of the room.
＃Maya
「What is to become of us...」
Maya-san whispered.
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... what are we going to do...?」
I asked Souko-san.
＃Souko
「Don't ask me. You should be asking the people who live here.」
＃Benio
「...At the very least, there is no doubt that the person who cut his throat is right here in this room.」
Benio-san whispered something chilling.
＃Benio
「The question is how to smoke them out... Hakase!」
Mikanagi-sensei, who was near Maya-san, was summoned over.
＃Mikanagi
「Yes?」
＃Benio
「Hakase, can you determine the cause of death and such?」
＃Mikanagi
「...My specialty is internal medicine. I only have a basic knowledge of forensic medicine.」
＃Benio
「I see. Could you examine him anyway, and tell us whatever you can?」
＃Mikanagi
「But...」
＃Benio
「The police can't get here. If we wait too long, it’ll be impossible to even determine the time of death, won't it?」
＃Mikanagi
「That’s true, but... I need to see Isamu's body first. I haven't even seen it yet.」
＃Benio
「Right... of course, my apologies. ...Tsujimura!」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, Ojousama?」
Tsujimura-san approached.
＃Benio
「Let me see the key to Rokuyou's room.」
＃Tsujimura
「But... is it wise to disturb the scene on our own?」
＃Benio
「It's an emergency, we have no choice.」
＃Souko
「She’s right. ...Just don't forget that the person who did that to him is still out there.」
＃Benio
「...I know. But we can't do anything until we know the time of death.」
＃Protagonist
「...Shouldn't we go and check one more time?」
Talking about it here wasn't going to get us anywhere.
And I’m sure Mikanagi-sensei wanted to go see the scene as soon as possible.
＃Benio
「You’re remarkably calm.」
＃Protagonist
「I’m not calm at all; I’m terrified. That’s why I can't just stand around.」
That was my honest feeling.
＃Souko
「He’s always been good in a crisis.」
＃Protagonist
「...Not really.」
＃Benio
「Hmm... then let's do this. Would you be willing to investigate for us?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... me?」
＃Benio
「To be honest, I don't trust my own family right now.」
Benio-san whispered under her breath.
＃Benio
「I still don't know why Rokuyou was killed, but I don't think it was for robbery. It was likely someone in the house?including me.」
＃Souko
「...Do you have a reason to kill him?」
＃Benio
「Not really. I have no interest in the inheritance or anything else.」
＃Protagonist
「In that case, wouldn't it be better if you investigated, Benio-san? This is your house, after all.」
＃Benio
「Since the police can't get here, it would be better to have an outsider investigate as objectively as possible.」
I wasn't sure about being asked to take on such an important role...
＃Protagonist
「Then wouldn't Souko-san be a better choice?」
＃Souko
「Of course I’ll help. But you can be the one to take the lead, can't you?」
＃Protagonist
「I guess, as long as you're helping me...」
＃Benio
「Then it’s settled. I’ll give you the key to the scene.」
I took the key from Benio-san.
＃Benio
「Hakase, would you go examine him?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, but could you stay with the Madam and the others? They seem quite distraught.」
＃Benio
「...Understood.」
Benio-san headed over to Maya-san and the others.
＃Souko
「...Well then, shall we?」
We made our way toward Rokuyou-san’s room.
