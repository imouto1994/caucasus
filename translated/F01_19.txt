I've come to the very end of the west side of the second floor.
This should be Maya-san's room.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
#Maya
"Oh... did you need something?"
#Protagonist
"Um, do you have a moment?"
#Maya
"I have preparations for the ceremony, so I can't spare much time, but please, come in."
With that, Maya-san led me into the room.
Maya-san's room was even more spacious than the others.
#Maya
"So, what is your business?"
#Protagonist
"Uh... well..."
I've come to Maya-san's room at the far end of the west side of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
#Maya
"Oh... did you need something?"
#Protagonist
"Um, do you have a moment?"
#Maya
"Yes, I don't mind... please, come inside."
With that, Maya-san led me into the room.
#Maya
"What would your business be?"
#Protagonist
"Uh... well..."
I've come to Maya-san's room at the far end of the west side of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
#Protagonist
"Huh... I guess she's not in."
Maybe she's preparing for the wedding.
Oh well, I'll go somewhere else.
