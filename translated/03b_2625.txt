When I returned to the office, Maya-san was there, which was unusual.
#Main Character
"Ah... Maya-san..."
#Maya
"Oh... were you with Shion?"
#Main Character
"Yes... there was something I absolutely had to confirm..."
#Maya
"I see... By the way, did Shion take her medicine?"
#Main Character
"Ah... since Dr. Mikanagi passed away, she probably hasn't yet."
#Maya
"I see... just as I thought... I'm glad I brought it then."
#Main Character
"Um... well, I'll be taking my leave now."
#Maya
"Yes, good night to you."
Leaving Maya-san behind, I stepped out of the office.
