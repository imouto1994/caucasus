When I returned to the office, Maya-san was there, which was unusual.
＃Protagonist
「Ah... Maya-san...」
＃Maya
「Oh... were you with Shion?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes... there was something I absolutely had to confirm...」
＃Maya
「I see... By the way, did Shion take her medicine?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah... since Dr. Mikanagi passed away, she probably hasn't yet.」
＃Maya
「I see... just as I thought... I'm glad I brought it then.」
＃Protagonist
「Um... well, I'll be taking my leave now.」
＃Maya
「Yes, good night to you.」
Leaving Maya-san behind, I stepped out of the office.
