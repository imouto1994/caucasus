Small glass vials of medicine are lined up.
With my knowledge, I have almost no idea what kinds of medicines are here.
I can't really mess with them, so I'll leave them be.
It's probably best not to touch them too much.
There's something that looks like medicine inside.
I wonder if it's for herbal medicine; it looks like some kind of tree roots are stored there too.
It's probably best not to touch them too much.
Disinfectants and bandages seem to be placed here.

Some kind of documents are sitting on the desk.
I shouldn't just look at them without permission.
Documents are sitting here.
Snow is dancing outside the window.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
There's a door other than the one I came through.
It probably connects to the archive next door.
It looks like a door connecting to the next room.
A simple bed, completely different from the ones in the other rooms, is placed here.
Well, it's an infirmary, so that makes sense...
There's no sign of the bed having been used.
Various documents are stored here.
As expected, I can't just look through them on my own...

In the bottom drawer, there was a beautiful card.
＃Protagonist
"What's this...?"
The card has 'r' written on it.
I'm a bit curious, so I'll decide to keep it.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and answer the question! This is what the answer column on the survey postcard was for!"
＃Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I'm a little curious, so I'll keep this card.
There's another piece of paper inside.
"Now all the cards are collected! Now, for the question you've been waiting for... If you rearrange the letters from before, they form a certain word."
"Translate that word into Japanese in a way that fits this work, and send in the survey postcard!"
"Deadline is January 11, 2010, postmark valid! Ten lucky winners will receive a small gift!"
＃Protagonist
"...Wow."
I feel like I kind of get it, but also kind of don't...
There's nothing out of the ordinary inside.
