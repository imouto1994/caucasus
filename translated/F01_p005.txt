"Shion-san? ...I haven't met her, so I can't really say. Though I'm sure we'll meet at the midnight wedding, so there's no rush."
＃Protagonist
"...True."
＃Maya
"Shion? She's been frail since she was small, and we were afraid of her catching some sort of infection, so we have her living in the annex."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Ai
"Shion... she hasn't set foot outside the manor since she was born. Perhaps because of that, she doesn't try to speak with people much."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Benio
"Shion is an incredibly bright child. However... she is desperately lacking in experience."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Shion? ...She sings such beautiful songs. I often find myself listening in a daze... ah, how embarrassing..."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Rokuyou
"About Shion? I was drawn to her gentle heart... haha, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about this so openly..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Shion-kun... she seems to have lived in that tower since long before I started coming here."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Mikanagi
"Shion-san is frail and suffers from headaches, so she takes medicine to suppress them every day. I only wish she would get better..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Lady Shion? She is always in the tower outside. You can go out through the door at the back of the office."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"Lady Shion? She doesn't seem to be able to eat much. She really needs to get some nutrition into her system..."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
