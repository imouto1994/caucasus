"Shion-san? ...I haven't met her, so I can't really say. Though I'm sure we'll meet at the midnight wedding, so there's no rush."
#Satoshi
"...True."
#Maya
"Shion? She's been frail since she was small, and we were afraid of her catching some sort of infection, so we have her living in the annex."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"Shion... she hasn't set foot outside the manor since she was born. Perhaps because of that, she doesn't try to speak with people much."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"Shion is an incredibly bright child. However... she is desperately lacking in experience."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Shion? ...She sings such beautiful songs. I often find myself listening in a daze... ah, how embarrassing..."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Rokuyou
"About Shion? I was drawn to her gentle heart... haha, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about this so openly..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Shion-kun... she seems to have lived in that tower since long before I started coming here."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Mikanagi
"Shion-san is frail and suffers from headaches, so she takes medicine to suppress them every day. I only wish she would get better..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Lady Shion? She is always in the tower outside. You can go out through the door at the back of the office."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"Lady Shion? She doesn't seem to be able to eat much. She really needs to get some nutrition into her system..."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
