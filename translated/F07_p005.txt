"I wonder if there's a connection between Shion-san being targeted and you two being locked in the basement..."
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
#Souko
"...There's a good chance Shion-san will be targeted by the killer. We have to make sure she's careful..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Maya
"To think even Shion was targeted..."
#Satoshi
"Her life isn't in danger, so please don't worry."
#Maya
"Shion is still safe, isn't she...?"
#Satoshi
"Yes... there's no need to worry."
#Ai
"Why even Shion... Why...!"
#Satoshi
"...We don't know that yet."
#Ai
"I'm glad it was me who was targeted... if it had been Shion..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
#Shion
"I'm... all right now. I'm sorry to have worried you."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"I... don't really understand what is happening... I am sorry..."
#Satoshi
"No..."
#Tsujimura
"So even Lady Shion is not safe after all..."
#Satoshi
"It seems so..."
#Tsujimura
"...Lady Shion seems to be quite depressed..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...Shion-kun is safe, I assume?"
#Satoshi
"Y-Yeah..."
#Takamine
"There's a possibility that danger could close in on Shion-kun as well. Keep an eye on her."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Mikanagi
"Shion-san's condition has mostly recovered. It seems the poison was a very small dose, and she threw it up immediately."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"If you're looking for Shion-san, she's likely in her room or the office."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"So even Lady Shion is being targeted... What on earth is the killer's objective...?"
#Satoshi
"Good question..."
#Akane
"Lady Shion? I believe she is likely in her room..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"I don't think you need to worry about Lady Shion's condition... but who could have done it..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Narumi
"If it's Lady Shion, she's probably in her room or the office, right?"
#Satoshi
"I see."
