Now I just have to deliver food to Shion-san.
I passed through the office and headed outside.
The snow was still falling as persistently as ever.
The door was unlocked.
Wanting to get the fried rice to her before it got cold, I hurried up the stairs.
I stood in front of Shion-san's room.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san, it's me. I've brought lunch.」
The door opened, and Shion-san peeked her face out.
＃Shion
「Ah... thank you very much.」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san has regained consciousness as well.」
＃Shion
「Is that true!? ...Thank goodness...」
Shion-san let out a long sigh of relief.
＃Protagonist
「The culprit hasn't been identified yet, so please don't let your guard down.」
＃Shion
「Y-Yes...」
Well, if she stays separated in a place like this, there probably isn't much to worry about.
＃Protagonist
「Well then, I'll be going.」
＃Shion
「A-Ah, um...!」
＃Protagonist
「Yes?」
＃Shion
「Please... b-be careful...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, I know.」
After answering Shion-san, I decided to return to the dining room.
