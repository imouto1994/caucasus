Narumi-san stopped in front of the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Everyone else, to the dining hall. I'll bring lunch over."
#Akane
"Understood."
#Satoshi
"Ah, I'll help too."
I stepped forward a few paces and stood beside Narumi-san.
#Narumi
"Hmm...? Fine, help me then."
#Satoshi
"Yeah."
Narumi-san opened the door to the kitchen.
#Narumi
"—Are you planning to keep an eye on me?"
As soon as we were alone, Narumi-san brought it up.
#Satoshi
"That's not it."
#Narumi
"I wonder. You don't think I'm going to poison the food, do you?"
#Satoshi
"I don't think that. After all, if the food was poisoned, the first person to be suspected would be you, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"So you're saying I wouldn't do something so stupid?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Narumi
"...You seem to think more rationally than that lawyer."
Narumi-san let out a breath.
#Satoshi
"You mean Takamine-san? ...Things certainly seemed tense earlier..."
#Narumi
"He has a big frame but a small heart, that man."
Narumi-san spat out.
#Satoshi
"A-Anyway, let's take the food over."
#Narumi
"Ah, right. Just wait a second."
Saying so, Narumi-san headed toward the stove.
It seemed she was reheating the rice in a pot.
#Narumi
"Well then, could you start taking the plates I've served to the dining hall?"
#Satoshi
"Understood."
I took several plates of fried rice and headed to the dining hall.
