Narumi-san stopped in front of the kitchen.
＃Narumi
「Everyone else, to the dining hall. I'll bring lunch over.」
＃Akane
「Understood.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, I'll help too.」
I stepped forward a few paces and stood beside Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
「Hmm...? Fine, help me then.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah.」
Narumi-san opened the door to the kitchen.
＃Narumi
「?Are you planning to keep an eye on me?」
As soon as we were alone, Narumi-san brought it up.
＃Protagonist
「That's not it.」
＃Narumi
「I wonder. You don't think I'm going to poison the food, do you?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't think that. After all, if the food was poisoned, the first person to be suspected would be you, Narumi-san.」
＃Narumi
「So you're saying I wouldn't do something so stupid?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Narumi
「...You seem to think more rationally than that lawyer.」
Narumi-san let out a breath.
＃Protagonist
「You mean Takamine-san? ...Things certainly seemed tense earlier...」
＃Narumi
「He has a big frame but a small heart, that man.」
Narumi-san spat out.
＃Protagonist
「A-Anyway, let's take the food over.」
＃Narumi
「Ah, right. Just wait a second.」
Saying so, Narumi-san headed toward the stove.
It seemed she was reheating the rice in a pot.
＃Narumi
「Well then, could you start taking the plates I've served to the dining hall?」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
I took several plates of fried rice and headed to the dining hall.
