「Excuse me.」
I follow Tsujimura-san into the office.
＃Tsujimura
「Please, have a seat over there.」
I sit down on the chair as suggested.
＃Protagonist
「Um…… Tsujimura-san?」
I ask Tsujimura-san what he wants to talk about.
＃Tsujimura
「……My apologies. For things to turn out like this……」
＃Protagonist
「No…… it's not your fault, Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「However…… with Mr. Rokuyou murdered and Miss Ai dead…… as the one responsible for managing this manor, I feel terribly sorry……」
Tsujimura-san looks down.
He looks so small.
＃Tsujimura
「……In the past, something similar happened.」
＃Protagonist
「Something similar……!?」
＃Tsujimura
「No, naturally nobody died. However…… because of my own incompetence, I once caused a great deal of trouble for the Madam and the others……」
At Tsujimura-san's confession, I feel a slight sense of relief.
I couldn't bear it if things like this happened all the time.
＃Tsujimura
「Even now, I find myself thinking about it. I wonder if there was something more I could have done back then. It might be far too late for regrets now, though.」
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san……」
＃Tsujimura
「I'm begging you. Even if it's only while you're here…… could you please protect the young lady, Shion-ojousama……?」
＃Protagonist
「Well…… of course. I want to protect everyone.」
＃Tsujimura
「Ah…… thank you very much.」
Tsujimura-san bows deeply.
＃Protagonist
「That reminds me, when I went to check on Shion-san earlier, she seemed a bit dejected……」
＃Tsujimura
「……If she seems to be troubled by something, please, by all means, offer her your advice.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, understood. But…… I don't know how much help I can be, having only just met her……」
＃Tsujimura
「Her way of thinking will be completely different from an old man like myself. Someone closer to her age should be the one to listen to her.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah……」
It's true, I wanted to talk to Shion-san a little more.
She must be feeling anxious too.
That's why I wanted to take away that anxiety, even if only a little.
＃Protagonist
「……I'll go check on her for a bit.」
＃Tsujimura
「Understood. I'm counting on you.」
