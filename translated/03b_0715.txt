As I went down the stairs, Souko-san, Tsujimura-san, and Dr. Mikanagi were talking.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san...」
＃Souko
「I've explained the situation.」
＃Tsujimura
「Um... Benio-ojousama is...」
Tsujimura-san's voice trembled.
＃Souko
「...I know it's painful, but Tsujimura-san, could you please go and inform the others?」
＃Tsujimura
「...Yes, I understand...」
His shoulders slumped, Tsujimura-san walked away.
I couldn't bring myself to speak to him.
＃Mikanagi
「Well then... shall we go?」
Urged on by Dr. Mikanagi, we decided to return to the performance room on the second floor.
