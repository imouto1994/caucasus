"Souko-san, you're surprisingly calm in this situation."
#Souko
"You're plenty calm yourself. Well, it's highly likely to be an internal dispute, so I figure it's unlikely to catch us in the crossfire."
#Maya
"For things to turn out like this... I feel terribly sorry for our guests."
#Protagonist
"N-No, please don't let it trouble you."
#Benio
"It feels like someone who can finally hold their own against me has arrived."
#Protagonist
"I-Is that so..."
#Shion
"Kirihara-san... she has a somewhat frightening atmosphere about her..."
#Protagonist
"Do you think so...?"
#Tsujimura
"I feel terribly sorry to Kirihara-sama and the others that things have turned out this way..."
#Protagonist
"No, please don't worry about it..."
#Takamine
"It seems you and the others are playing detective... but it's best not to provoke the culprit more than necessary."
#Protagonist
"That might be true, but..."
#Mikanagi
"The swelling in Kirihara-san's finger hasn't gone down yet. It's possible... that it might be fractured."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Kirihara-san? She seems to be investigating all sorts of things."
#Protagonist
"Right."
