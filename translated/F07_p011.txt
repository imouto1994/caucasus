＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」

「What on earth could have happened...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I'm in the middle of investigating that right now.」

＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Takamine
「It seems Rokuyou-kun was murdered during the night... but there weren't any sounds of a struggle. It might be because the rooms are well soundproofed...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」

＃Narumi
「...I thought it was strange when he didn't show up this morning, but to think he'd been murdered...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
