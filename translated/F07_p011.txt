"I wonder why Rokuyou-san had to be murdered... that's what's really bothering me."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"...Why was a man like Isamu-san murdered...?"
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Ai
"Isamu-san... why...?"
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
#Benio
"...I question whether Rokuyou truly loved Shion. I never once saw them acting affectionately, after all."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Shion
"What on earth could have happened...?"
#Satoshi
"...I'm in the middle of investigating that right now."
#Tsujimura
"Master Rokuyou's remains are laid to rest in his room. We cannot simply bury him as we please, after all..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Takamine
"It seems Rokuyou-kun was murdered during the night... but there weren't any sounds of a struggle. It might be because the rooms are well soundproofed..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"To think Isamu would meet such a fate..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Akane
"For Master Rokuyou to pass away like that..."
#Satoshi
"Akane-san..."
#Narumi
"...I thought it was strange when he didn't show up this morning, but to think he'd been murdered..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
