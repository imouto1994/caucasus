"The bell might not ring anymore."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
#Maya
"Since the clock has broken... and we can't have it repaired right away..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"I'd rather not talk about that place..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Benio
"The gears are busted. It'll be useless for a while."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"The clock is broken, after all... I suppose we'll just have to leave it as it is for a while."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"The killer might have timed the bells to set their trap."
#Satoshi
"Yeah, maybe..."
#Mikanagi
"...The clock probably won't be usable for a while."
#Satoshi
"Right."
#Akane
"...Maybe the clock will just stay like that forever."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Narumi
"It's a clock no one looks at anyway. With the police investigation and everything, I'd bet it'll stay like that for a while."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
