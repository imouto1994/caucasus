"The lid of that coffin in the chapel is heavy, so it doesn't look like a girl could open it alone."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Maya
"The chapel is only used for things like weddings, so it's usually kept locked."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"I'm told that chapel was always used for weddings in the Nanatsuki family."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"The chapel is almost never used in our daily lives."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Shion
"The chapel... I don't want to spend any more time there."
#Tsujimura
"The chapel is locked. I doubt it will be used again for quite some time."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Please don't hang around places where you have no business."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"I hear the chapel isn't used under normal circumstances."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"Cleaning the chapel is quite a chore. It doesn't get that dirty since it's not normally used, though."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"A chapel that's only used for weddings... feels a bit extravagant, doesn't it?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah, it does..."
