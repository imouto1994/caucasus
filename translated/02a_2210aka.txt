I arrived in front of Akane-san's room on the first floor.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san, it's me. Are you there?"
I called out and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
I wonder if she's not there, or if she's already asleep—
Just as I gave up and turned around.
#Akane
"Oh? Did something happen?"
I heard Akane-san's voice from behind me.
#Protagonist
"Ah... Akane-san, were you in the dining room?"
#Akane
"Yes. I still have some work to do. ...By the way, what can I do for you?"
#Protagonist
"Ah, there might be danger again tonight, so I thought I'd protect you through the night."
#Akane
"Eh... eeehh!?"
Akane-san let out a cry of surprise and took a few steps back.
#Akane
"No, um, even if you say that so suddenly, I'm not mentally prepared...!"
#Protagonist
"No, no! It's not anything strange like that, so please don't misunderstand!"
#Akane
"B-But, well... that's what you mean, right...?"
#Protagonist
"What on earth do you mean...?"
#Akane
"Jeez... please don't trouble your big sister so much."
Akane-san placed her hands on her hips and pouted.
#Protagonist
"...Well, I might be younger than you, but."
#Akane
"I still have work to do, and Narumi-san is nearby, so there's no need to worry. Please get some rest, guest."
#Protagonist
"I-I see..."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
