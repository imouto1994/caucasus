"I wonder if this is enough."
#Souko
"If you think it's enough, then isn't it?"
#Main Character
"It makes me anxious when you say it like that..."
Keep searching
It should be enough
I'll search a little more.
I might have missed something.
I think I've searched enough.
#Main Character
"I think we're okay now."
#Mikanagi
"Well then, let's carry Benio-san to her room."
Making a simple stretcher out of sheets, we placed Benio-san's body upon it.
Dr. Mikanagi and I carried the stretcher together.
We laid Benio-san's body onto the bed.
Benio-san's black cat climbed onto the bed and curled up as if nestling against the body.
#Main Character
"...Come here."
#Main Character
"...Benio-san is gone now."
As if understanding my words, the black cat stood up and left the room with its tail drooping.
#Souko
"...Let's step out too."
Stepping into the corridor, we locked the room.
#Mikanagi
"I'll entrust this key to Tsujimura-san."
#Main Character
"Yeah... please do."
#Souko
"Let's check in with everyone just in case. We might learn something."
