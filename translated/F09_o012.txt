＃Souko
「...At the very least, the killer has no intention of letting anyone escape from here.」
＃Protagonist
「...Maybe not.」
＃Maya
「Even the suspension bridge... We can't even call for help like this...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Ai
「We can't even go for help...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Benio
「There's no point in worrying about it now.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Shion
「The suspension bridge... Who would do such a thing...?」
＃Protagonist
「The killer, most likely...」
＃Tsujimura
「This is a problem... We can't possibly fix that bridge on our own...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Takamine
「...The killer probably intends to increase the number of victims. Otherwise, there'd be no point in dropping the bridge.」
＃Protagonist
「...You might be right.」
＃Mikanagi
「Without the bridge, you boys won't be able to go home... Though with everything that's happened, you might not be able to leave even if the police arrive.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Akane
「This place is surrounded by cliffs, so without the bridge, you can't go anywhere...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「Even if the bridge is gone, we have plenty of food, so we'll be fine. ...Well, Kirihara-san will just have to give up on her cola, I guess.」
＃Protagonist
「Right... I'll let her know.」
