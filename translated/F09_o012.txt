"...At the very least, the killer has no intention of letting anyone escape from here."
#Satoshi
"...Maybe not."
#Maya
"Even the suspension bridge... We can't even call for help like this..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Ai
"We can't even go for help..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Benio
"There's no point in worrying about it now."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Shion
"The suspension bridge... Who would do such a thing...?"
#Satoshi
"The killer, most likely..."
#Tsujimura
"This is a problem... We can't possibly fix that bridge on our own..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Takamine
"...The killer probably intends to increase the number of victims. Otherwise, there'd be no point in dropping the bridge."
#Satoshi
"...You might be right."
#Mikanagi
"Without the bridge, you boys won't be able to go home... Though with everything that's happened, you might not be able to leave even if the police arrive."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Akane
"This place is surrounded by cliffs, so without the bridge, you can't go anywhere..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Even if the bridge is gone, we have plenty of food, so we'll be fine. ...Well, Kirihara-san will just have to give up on her cola, I guess."
#Satoshi
"Right... I'll let her know."
