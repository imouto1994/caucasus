I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she's not here after all.
I wonder where on earth Akane-san could be...
＃Protagonist
「Oh...」
Without thinking, I twist the doorknob, and the door opens with a click.
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san... are you in there...?」
I gently open the door and peek inside.
The room is dead silent.
It seems Akane-san isn't here.
What should I do...
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
When I twist the doorknob, the door opens easily.

She doesn't seem to be here.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.

＃Protagonist
「Akane-san, it's me.」
The door opens, and Akane-san pokes her head out.
＃Akane
「Ah, is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「I'm just doing rounds of the mansion right now... Has anything unusual happened?」
＃Akane
「No, nothing in particular... Is there anything else?」
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.

「Oh, what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「I'm still in the middle of doing rounds...」
