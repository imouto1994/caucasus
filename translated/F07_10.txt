I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she's not here after all.
I wonder where on earth Akane-san could be...

"Oh..."
Without thinking, I twist the doorknob, and the door opens with a click.

"Akane-san... are you in there...?"
I gently open the door and peek inside.
The room is dead silent.
It seems Akane-san isn't here.
What should I do...
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
When I twist the doorknob, the door opens easily.
Now then... what should I do?
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
She doesn't seem to be here.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.

"Akane-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Akane-san pokes her head out.
#Akane
"Ah, is something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"I'm just doing rounds of the mansion right now... Has anything unusual happened?"
#Akane
"No, nothing in particular... Is there anything else?"

"Oh, what is it this time?"
#Satoshi
"I'm still in the middle of doing rounds..."
