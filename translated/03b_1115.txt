Souko-san straightened her disheveled clothes.
#Souko
"Hey..."
#Main Character
"Yes...?"
#Souko
"Will you really... protect me?"
#Main Character
"Of course I will."
#Souko
"...Thank you."
It was just as she whispered that and leaned in to hug me.
#Main Character
"Whoa...!?"
A jolt struck from below, pushing upward.
It was a vibration so intense it felt like an earthquake or an avalanche.
#Souko
"Kya!?"
Souko-san clung to me tightly.
#Main Character
"Did something happen on the first floor?"
#Souko
"It certainly felt like the impact came from below... let's go."
Releasing her hold on me, Souko-san’s expression had returned to its usual dignified composure.
#Main Character
"Ye-yeah..."
We rushed out into the corridor and headed for the first floor.
