Souko-san straightened her disheveled clothes.
＃Souko
「Hey...」
＃Protagonist
「Yes...?」
＃Souko
「Will you really... protect me?」
＃Protagonist
「Of course I will.」
＃Souko
「...Thank you.」
It was just as she whispered that and leaned in to hug me.
＃Protagonist
「Whoa...!?」
A jolt struck from below, pushing upward.
It was a vibration so intense it felt like an earthquake or an avalanche.
＃Souko
「Kya!?」
Souko-san clung to me tightly.
＃Protagonist
「Did something happen on the first floor?」
＃Souko
「It certainly felt like the impact came from below... let's go.」
Releasing her hold on me, Souko-san’s expression had returned to its usual dignified composure.
＃Protagonist
「Ye-yeah...」
We rushed out into the corridor and headed for the first floor.
