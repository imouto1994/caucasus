"Perhaps the bell won't ring anymore."
#Protagonist
"You're right."
#Maya
"The clock is broken... and we can't fix it right away..."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Ai
"I’d rather not talk about that place..."
#Protagonist
"I understand..."
#Benio
"The gears are broken. It won't be good for anything for a while."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"The clock is broken, you see... we'll just have to leave it like that for now."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Takamine
"The culprit might have timed their trap to coincide with the ringing of the bell."
#Protagonist
"You're right..."
#Mikanagi
"...The clock likely won't be usable for a while."
#Protagonist
"Right."
#Akane
"...Perhaps the clock will be left just as it is."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Narumi

#Protagonist
"...I see."
