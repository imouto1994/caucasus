#Main Character
"Well... I think this is enough."
Keep looking
That's enough
I'll look a little more...
Alright.
Now, how to escape using what I've gathered...
#Narumi
"Honestly... if it were just locked, I could get us out easily..."
Narumi-san muttered irritably.
#Main Character
"...Isn't it more troublesome if it's locked?"
#Narumi
"Because locks are easier—"
Suddenly, Narumi-san cut herself off.
#Main Character
"Locks are easier?"
#Narumi
"Ah... um, in terms of ease of opening, I mean."
#Main Character
"...I would think that if it’s locked, you wouldn't be able to open it..."
#Narumi
"Well, there are ways."
#Main Character
"No, there aren't."
She’s clearly hiding something...
If she can open locks...
#Main Character
"...Now that I think about it, this morning, when you came to my room, Narumi-san... my door was locked, wasn't it?"
#Narumi
"Ah... ahh... yeah."
#Main Character
"...I thought so."
Which means the only logical conclusion is—
#Main Character
"...Now that I think about it, this morning, when we were looking for Akane-san, you came out of the chapel, and that was locked."
#Narumi
"W... well..."
#Main Character
"You said you searched Mr. Kousei's room too, but you don't have a key to that room, do you, Narumi-san?"
Narumi-san looked away.
#Main Character
"...I thought so."
Which means the logical conclusion is—
#Main Character
"Are you, Narumi-san... are you a—"
Thief
Locksmith
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, is your true identity... a thief or something?"
I voiced my thought.
#Narumi
"...And if it is, then what?"
Narumi-san tensed up.
#Main Character
"It’s nothing, really. Honestly, we have bigger things to worry about right now."
First, we have to think about how to get out of this basement.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, is your true identity... a locksmith?"
I voiced my thought.
#Narumi
"No."
#Main Character
"Oh... you aren't?"
I really thought I was onto something...
#Main Character
"In that case, the only other thing I can think of is a thief... but surely not."
#Narumi
"...Exactly that."
#Main Character
"...Eh?"
#Narumi
"That's right, I'm a thief."
#Main Character
"...Sigh."
#Narumi
"Hey, why the puzzled look!?"
#Main Character
"Well, I mean... you're a maid, aren't you, Narumi-san?"
#Narumi
"That’s just my cover... oh, honestly! Why do I have to explain this!"
Narumi-san stomped her feet.
#Main Character
"...So, as a thief, Narumi-san, do you have any way to get us out?"
#Narumi
"If I did, I wouldn't be having such a hard time."
Narumi-san grumbled, looking somewhat sulky for some reason.
#Main Character
"It looks like we’ll have to make do with what we have here..."
I lined up the items I’d found in the storage room.
Using them individually won't work, so... what should I do?
This is all I have...
#Main Character
"Sorry, Narumi-san, I don't have anything that looks useful except for the cola..."
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
I managed to nail the piece of wood with the hammer.
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
What should I combine this with...?
#Main Character
"I hope this works..."
I took the tool, put my arm through the grate, and tried to move the bar.
#Main Character
"Hup... ngh...!"
I swung my arm around, but I couldn't even graze the rod.
#Main Character
"Dammit... just a little more..."
#Main Character
"...Ah"
#Narumi
"It came off!?"
I pulled my hand back and slowly moved the sliding door.
#Main Character
"...I managed to reach it, just barely."
#Narumi
"Thank goodness..."
I supported Narumi-san as she looked ready to collapse onto the floor.
#Main Character
"Let's hurry. The culprit might be up to something while we’re stuck down here."
#Narumi
"Eh, ah... right."
#Main Character
"If something happens... I'll be counting on your skills as a thief, Narumi-san."
#Narumi
"...That sounds a bit like blackmail."
#Main Character
"It's not."
It's just a fact that we might need your help.
#Narumi
"Fine, let’s go."
We went up the stairs and out of the basement.
#Main Character
"I hope this works..."
#Narumi
"Um... look, I hate to say it... but no matter how you look at it, isn't that a failure?"
#Main Character
"We won't know until we try."
I took the tool, put my arm through the grate, and tried to move the bar.
#Main Character
"Hup... ngh...!"
I swung my arm around, but I couldn't even graze the rod.
#Main Character
"Dammit... just a little more..."
#Main Character
"...Ah"
#Narumi
"Did it come off?"
#Main Character
"Um..."
I slowly brought my empty hand back inside.
#Narumi
"...? Where's the thing you just had?"
#Main Character
"...I dropped it on the floor."
#Narumi
"What!?"
Narumi-san rushed to the door and peered outside.
#Narumi
"Y... you... what on earth are you doing..."
#Main Character
"...I'm sorry."
#Narumi
"Honestly... now what?"
#Main Character
"...Should we just wait for help...?"
#Narumi
"Our only choice... is to break through this wall."
Narumi-san said, staring at the wall.
#Main Character
"Are you serious?"
#Narumi
"You're the one who said we could break through it."
#Main Character
"I did, but..."
I don't think it's a good idea to go around breaking someone else's house...
#Narumi
"Then first, peel off this wooden board for me."
#Main Character
"Sigh..."
I guess I have no choice... I don't know how long it’ll take, but it’s better than doing nothing.
Feeling like a prison escapee, I put my hand into the gap in the wall.
After shaking the door for a while, there was a sudden clatter.
#Main Character
"Ah..."
#Narumi
"Did it open?"
#Main Character
"Ye-Yes..."
The door opened.
The rod was lying on the floor outside.
#Main Character
"Who on earth would do such a thing..."
#Narumi
"Whatever, let's go up."
We went up the stairs and out of the basement.
