「Whether they were targeting a person, a location, or if there was some other motive... it's still not clear.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Maya
「The kitchen... if it's like that, we won't be able to prepare any meals...」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Ai
「...I'm just relieved it ended with only minor injuries. But why on earth the kitchen...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I still don't know.」
＃Benio
「The kitchen, huh... Don't you think the nature of this is far too different from before to be targeting a person?」
＃Protagonist
「That might be true...」
＃Shion
「The kitchen... what on earth happened...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I still don't know.」
＃Tsujimura
「...The kitchen does use gas, so it would be prone to explosions, but...」
＃Protagonist
「That's true...」
＃Takamine
「The damage is limited to the destruction of the kitchen and some minor burns... It's fortunate there were few casualties.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Takamine
「...I also suffered a major burn once in the past.」
＃Protagonist
「That... the scar on your face...?」
＃Takamine
「...Yeah. There was a fire at a mountain hut near here a long time ago, and that's when I got it.」
＃Protagonist
「Something like that happened...?」
＃Mikanagi
「The injury itself isn't serious... but I wonder why she was the one targeted...?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Akane
「She was so close to being seriously injured...」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I'm glad she's okay.」
＃Narumi
「That was close... A little more and I would've had a nasty burn.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
