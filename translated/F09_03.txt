There was no one in the grand hall.
Well... what should I do?
When I entered the grand hall, Takamine-san was sitting on the sofa.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Takamine-san.」
＃Takamine
「...Did something happen?」
He gives me a sharp, sideways glare as he stands up.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san—I mean, Kirihara's room was ransacked, and there was writing on the wall in what looks like blood.」
＃Takamine
「...That sounds ominous.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... Did you see anyone acting strangely?」
＃Takamine
「I don't pay much attention to what others are doing.」
Takamine-san answers flatly.
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「Was there something else?」
Takamine-san was still in the grand hall.
＃Takamine
「Do you still need something?」
