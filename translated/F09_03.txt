There was no one in the grand hall.
Well... what should I do?
When I entered the grand hall, Takamine-san was sitting on the sofa.
#Satoshi
"Ah, Takamine-san."
#Takamine
"...Did something happen?"
He gives me a sharp, sideways glare as he stands up.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san—I mean, Kirihara's room was ransacked, and there was writing on the wall in what looks like blood."
#Takamine
"...That sounds ominous."
#Satoshi
"Yeah... Did you see anyone acting strangely?"
#Takamine
"I don't pay much attention to what others are doing."
Takamine-san answers flatly.
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Was there something else?"
Takamine-san was still in the grand hall.
#Takamine
"Do you still need something?"
