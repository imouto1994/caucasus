I stepped out of the office.
Even at night, the snow continued to fall without cease.
I hurried toward the tower.
I entered the tower and went up the stairs to the second floor.
＃Shion
「Who is it...?」
＃Protagonist
「It's me, Shion-san.」
When I called out, I heard the sound of the door being unlocked.
＃Shion
「Is... something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san... I'm going to stay here tonight to protect you.」
＃Shion
「Eh...」
Shion-san gasped.
And for good reason.
Anyone would be surprised if they were suddenly told something like that.
＃Protagonist
「Right now, the person most likely to be targeted by the culprit is you, Shion-san. So, I want to protect you no matter what.」
＃Shion
「B-But...」
＃Protagonist
「Of course, I don't mean staying inside your room. Since there's only one entrance here, I'll stand guard on the first floor of the tower.」
＃Shion
「But... um, it'll get cold... you'll catch a cold.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm young, so I'll be fine.」
＃Shion
「Um... in that case, there are spare blankets in the storage room downstairs...」
Shion-san offered.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, that's... thank you very much. That'll be a big help.」
＃Shion
「Um... please don't overexert yourself, okay?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, I know.」
I parted with Shion-san and went down to the first floor.
Just as she’d said, I pulled a blanket out from the storage room, wrapped myself in it, and sat down on the very bottom step of the stairs.
This place is far from the manor.
It'd be hard for anyone to notice if something happened.
However, there's only one entrance.
If anyone tries to harm Shion-san, staying here means I'll definitely notice.
＃Protagonist
「Phew...」
Now, I just have to endure until dawn.
I wonder if I'll be able to sleep even a little bit...
＃Protagonist
「I'm young, so I'll be fine. Well then—」
Just as I said that and turned to leave.
＃Shion
「A-Ah, um—」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
Someone grabbed the hem of my clothes from behind.
＃Protagonist
「W... what is it...?」
＃Shion
「Um...」
Shion-san kept her head down while still gripping the hem of my clothes.
＃Shion
「Well... I-I trust you... so please... stay in my room and... protect me.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh... but...」
＃Shion
「...To tell you the truth, I don't think I'll be able to sleep... could you please... tell me some fun stories or something...?」
Shion-san's hands were trembling slightly.
＃Protagonist
「...I understand.」
She really must be scared; Shion-san gently opened the door wide and invited me into the room.
I sat down on the chair Shion-san offered and began to talk.
＃Protagonist
「Well then... I'll tell you about something that happened at university. Though I'm not sure if it'll be interesting.」
＃Shion
「No... would you let me hear it?」
＃Protagonist
「...It's about Souko-san, who came here with me; she's just someone who has no luck whatsoever. Whenever she tries to buy something, it's guaranteed to sell out right in front of her.」
＃Shion
「Oh my...」
＃Protagonist
「Besides that, she was the only one whose exam question sheet was blank, or her pepper lid broke and her ramen turned into a disaster...」
＃Shion
「That... sounds tough...」
＃Protagonist
「Anyway, she's unlucky in all sorts of minor ways. I get caught up in it too... like the books I need for research always being on loan no matter how long I wait...」
I continued talking for a while.
Shion-san was nodding with a soft expression on her face.
Thank goodness... it seems her anxiety has faded.
＃Protagonist
「Ah... sorry, I've been doing all the talking.」
＃Shion
「No... it's alright. I don't have any fun stories to tell others, after all.」
Shion-san said, sounding a little bit lonely.
＃Protagonist
「Shion-san...」
＃Shion
「...University sounds like a fun place, doesn't it.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... well.」
＃Shion
「It felt very fresh. You can't understand it just from reading books... thank you.」
Shion-san bowed while looking bashful.
＃Protagonist
「No... I'm happy if you enjoyed it.」
＃Shion
「Hehe...」
＃Protagonist
「...W-Well, shall we get some rest soon? It's getting late...」
＃Shion
「You're right...」
＃Protagonist
「Then, could you just lend me a blanket? I'll be by the door.」
＃Shion
「Y-Yes...」
Shion-san brought a blanket over from the bed.
＃Shion
「Is this alright...?」
＃Protagonist
「Thank you.」
I took the blanket, draped it over myself, and sat down by the door.
＃Protagonist
「It might be a bit unsettling, but... good night, Shion-san.」
＃Shion
「Yes... good night.」
Shion-san turned off the light.
This place is far from the manor.
It'd be hard for anyone to notice if something happened.
However, there's only one entrance.
If anyone tries to harm Shion-san, staying here means I'll definitely notice.
Now, I just have to endure until dawn.
I wonder if I'll be able to sleep even a little bit...
