＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san—"
I returned to the office and called for Tsujimura-san first thing.
However, he was not in the office.
＃Protagonist
"Wait—"
Where could he have gone?
We don't have time to be taking it easy.
I have to tell him quickly that Shion-san has died.
I went out into the corridor.
It seemed people were gathering in the main hall.
At this hour... what happened?
Tsujimura-san and Takamine-san were in the main hall.
＃Protagonist
"Um—Tsujimura-san, it's terrible. Shion-san... has passed away."
＃Tsujimura
"Eh... is that truly the case...!?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes... in her room just now..."
＃Takamine
"Dammit!"
Takamine-san dashed away.
Tsujimura-san seemed unable to move.
＃Tsujimura
"...How can this be... even Shion-ojousama..."
Tsujimura-san's shoulders slumped, and he looked down.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san..."
＃Tsujimura
"Actually... a short while ago, I confirmed that Ai-ojousama has also passed away."
＃Protagonist
"Eh..."
Ai-san too...?
＃Tsujimura
"I... I no longer understand what is happening..."
＃Protagonist
"...Tsujimura-san, is Maya-san... safe?"
＃Tsujimura
"The Madam... you say...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes... I believe Maya-san is the culprit's true target."
＃Tsujimura
"Who on earth... would do such a thing...?"
＃Protagonist
"That is..."
Until just a moment ago, I thought Shion-san was the one doing it.
But she is dead.
In that case, I'd like to think Maya-san is safe now, but...
Or—has it already been finished...?
＃Protagonist
"...Tsujimura-san, were you in the office the entire time?"
＃Tsujimura
"No... I had returned to my own room."
If that's the case, it's possible he came out before Shion-san died.
＃Protagonist
"...I understand. I'll go check on Maya-san."
＃Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... I will go to Shion-ojousama's place..."
Tsujimura-san left the main hall.
I must hurry too.
There's no guarantee Maya-san is safe, but—
When I reached the hall, Narumi-san emerged from the corridor on the opposite side.
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san, Shion-san has died."
When I reached the hall, Narumi-san came down from the second floor.
＃Narumi
"Ah—Ai-ojousama is..."
＃Protagonist
"...I just heard from Tsujimura-san."
＃Narumi
"I... I see..."
＃Protagonist
"And... Shion-san has died as well."
＃Narumi
"What—"
Narumi-san gasped and was left speechless.
＃Protagonist
"...So, I'm going to go check on Maya-san..."
＃Narumi
"...The Madam?"
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san visited the room before Shion-san died."
＃Narumi
"Eh... that's never happened before...? For the Madam to go to that tower..."
＃Protagonist
"...If that's the case, was it something special...?"
＃Narumi
"...Wait. What was Shion-ojousama's cause of death?"
＃Protagonist
"...Poison. I don't know if it was suicide or murder, but..."
＃Narumi
"Is there a possibility the Madam planted it?"
＃Protagonist
"...There is. A significant one."
＃Narumi
"I see. ...Shall we go?"
Narumi-san climbed the stairs.
The western corridor of the second floor.
Maya-san, who has lost three daughters, is at the back of this hall.
But... did she lose them, or did she kill them?
Everything must be brought to light.
＃Narumi
"Madam, how are you feeling?"
Narumi-san called out to the inside.
But there was no response.
＃Narumi
"That's strange, I wonder if she's sleeping..."
Narumi-san gently placed her hand on the doorknob.
＃Narumi
"It's open...?"
＃Protagonist
"Let's go in."
＃Narumi
"Eh, wait—"
I pushed past Narumi-san and opened the door.
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san... excuse me."
I called out.
The person lying on the bed—was.
＃Narumi
"You're... joking, right...?"
Narumi-san gasped.
The person lying there was.
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san...?"
...I knew instantly that she was dead.
Maya-san's corpse lay upon the bloodied bed.
＃Protagonist
"...Who..."
Did Shion-san do it?
Then was Shion-san's death a suicide?
But Maya-san went to Shion-san's room—
＃Narumi
"What... is this...?"
Narumi-san pointed to a piece of paper that had been placed beside Maya-san's body.
...It was written in blood.
＃Protagonist
"MY REVENGE IS COMPLETE. AKANE HIYAMA—"
＃Narumi
"Akane...!?"
＃Protagonist
"...Don't tell me, Akane-san...?"
Did she figure out that the Nanatsuki family was the reason Akari-san disappeared...?
In that case, all our previous predictions are overturned.
But it was also a fact that Akane-san had disappeared...
＃Narumi
"Just what on earth is happening..."
Narumi-san's clenched fist trembled.
＃Protagonist
"...I don't know either."
＃Narumi
"...Let's go back. It's best if everyone stays in one place and waits until tomorrow."
＃Protagonist
"B-But... we should investigate..."
＃Narumi
"Leave that to the police!"
Narumi-san shouted at the top of her lungs, then grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the room.
