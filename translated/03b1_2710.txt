#Main Character
"Tsujimura-san—"
I returned to the office and called for Tsujimura-san first thing.
However, he was not in the office.
#Main Character
"Wait—"
Where could he have gone?
We don't have time to be taking it easy.
I have to tell him quickly that Shion-san has died.
I went out into the corridor.
It seemed people were gathering in the main hall.
At this hour... what happened?
Tsujimura-san and Takamine-san were in the main hall.
#Main Character
"Um—Tsujimura-san, it's terrible. Shion-san... has passed away."
#Tsujimura
"Eh... is that truly the case...!?"
#Main Character
"Yes... in her room just now..."
#Takamine
"Dammit!"
Takamine-san dashed away.
Tsujimura-san seemed unable to move.
#Tsujimura
"...How can this be... even Shion-ojousama..."
Tsujimura-san's shoulders slumped, and he looked down.
#Main Character
"Tsujimura-san..."
#Tsujimura
"Actually... a short while ago, I confirmed that Ai-ojousama has also passed away."
#Main Character
"Eh..."
Ai-san too...?
#Tsujimura
"I... I no longer understand what is happening..."
#Main Character
"...Tsujimura-san, is Maya-san... safe?"
#Tsujimura
"The Madam... you say...?"
#Main Character
"Yes... I believe Maya-san is the culprit's true target."
#Tsujimura
"Who on earth... would do such a thing...?"
#Main Character
"That is..."
Until just a moment ago, I thought Shion-san was the one doing it.
But she is dead.
In that case, I'd like to think Maya-san is safe now, but...
Or—has it already been finished...?
#Main Character
"...Tsujimura-san, were you in the office the entire time?"
#Tsujimura
"No... I had returned to my own room."
If that's the case, it's possible he came out before Shion-san died.
#Main Character
"...I understand. I'll go check on Maya-san."
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes... I will go to Shion-ojousama's place..."
Tsujimura-san left the main hall.
I must hurry too.
There's no guarantee Maya-san is safe, but—
When I reached the hall, Narumi-san emerged from the corridor on the opposite side.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, Shion-san has died."
When I reached the hall, Narumi-san came down from the second floor.
#Narumi
"Ah—Ai-ojousama is..."
#Main Character
"...I just heard from Tsujimura-san."
#Narumi
"I... I see..."
#Main Character
"And... Shion-san has died as well."
#Narumi
"What—"
Narumi-san gasped and was left speechless.
#Main Character
"...So, I'm going to go check on Maya-san..."
#Narumi
"...The Madam?"
#Main Character
"Maya-san visited the room before Shion-san died."
#Narumi
"Eh... that's never happened before...? For the Madam to go to that tower..."
#Main Character
"...If that's the case, was it something special...?"
#Narumi
"...Wait. What was Shion-ojousama's cause of death?"
#Main Character
"...Poison. I don't know if it was suicide or murder, but..."
#Narumi
"Is there a possibility the Madam planted it?"
#Main Character
"...There is. A significant one."
#Narumi
"I see. ...Shall we go?"
Narumi-san climbed the stairs.
The western corridor of the second floor.
Maya-san, who has lost three daughters, is at the back of this hall.
But... did she lose them, or did she kill them?
Everything must be brought to light.
#Narumi
"Madam, how are you feeling?"
Narumi-san called out to the inside.
But there was no response.
#Narumi
"That's strange, I wonder if she's sleeping..."
Narumi-san gently placed her hand on the doorknob.
#Narumi
"It's open...?"
#Main Character
"Let's go in."
#Narumi
"Eh, wait—"
I pushed past Narumi-san and opened the door.
#Main Character
"Maya-san... excuse me."
I called out.
The person lying on the bed—was.
#Narumi
"You're... joking, right...?"
Narumi-san gasped.
The person lying there was.
#Main Character
"Maya-san...?"
...I knew instantly that she was dead.
Maya-san's corpse lay upon the bloodied bed.
#Main Character
"...Who..."
Did Shion-san do it?
Then was Shion-san's death a suicide?
But Maya-san went to Shion-san's room—
#Narumi
"What... is this...?"
Narumi-san pointed to a piece of paper that had been placed beside Maya-san's body.
...It was written in blood.
#Main Character
"MY REVENGE IS COMPLETE. AKANE HIYAMA—"
#Narumi
"Akane...!?"
#Main Character
"...Don't tell me, Akane-san...?"
Did she figure out that the Nanatsuki family was the reason Akari-san disappeared...?
In that case, all our previous predictions are overturned.
But it was also a fact that Akane-san had disappeared...
#Narumi
"Just what on earth is happening..."
Narumi-san's clenched fist trembled.
#Main Character
"...I don't know either."
#Narumi
"...Let's go back. It's best if everyone stays in one place and waits until tomorrow."
#Main Character
"B-But... we should investigate..."
#Narumi
"Leave that to the police!"
Narumi-san shouted at the top of her lungs, then grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the room.
