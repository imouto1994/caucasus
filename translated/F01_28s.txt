It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
The wind and snow seem to be getting stronger than they were this evening.
The blizzard outside seems to be intensifying.

I'll come back when the urge strikes.
I don't have any particular business here.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are stored.
It contains rags, buckets, and so on.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.

Of course, it's very clean and not cloudy at all.
A mirror is hanging on the wall.
When I turned the tap, cold water came out.
As expected, it might be a bit tough in this season.
The water has become very cold.
