It's the door leading back into the room.
An electric cord is coming in through the slight gap between the door and the floor.
I don't think there's any particular problem with the door itself.
On a towel hanging on the wall, a small piece of trash like a scrap of paper was stuck.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but……
There doesn't seem to be any back-spray from the blood on the towel.
#Satoshi
"Was this the cause of the short circuit……?"
#Souko
"Presumably so."
It seems the power cord submerged in the tub was the cause of the short circuit.
#Satoshi
"……A snowdrop."
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
#Satoshi
"Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san……?"
#Souko
"Likely so."
#Satoshi
"This flower is……?"
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
Why would it be in a place like this……
#Souko
"It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall…… I wonder if the fact that only the flower head has fallen is a metaphor for the headless body……"
#Satoshi
"……That's a gruesome thought."
A snowdrop flower is floating in the tub.
#Mikanagi
"……Let's wait until after we've pulled her out to perform the autopsy."
#Satoshi
"……You're right."
……I'll leave the examination of the body for later.
#Satoshi
"……The blood must have sprayed when the neck was cut."
#Souko
"But…… the head is missing again."
#Satoshi
"Did they take it with them……?"
#Souko
"I don't understand the reason. Unless this body belongs to someone other than Ai-san."
#Mikanagi
"……I'm certain it's Ai-san. I've examined her before, so I wouldn't mistake her."
#Satoshi
"I see……"
……They likely decapitated her here.
