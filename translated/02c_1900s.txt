It's the door leading back into the room.
An electric cord is coming in through the slight gap between the door and the floor.
I don't think there's any particular problem with the door itself.
On a towel hanging on the wall, a small piece of trash like a scrap of paper was stuck.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but……
There doesn't seem to be any back-spray from the blood on the towel.
＃Protagonist
「Was this the cause of the short circuit……?」
＃Souko
「Presumably so.」
It seems the power cord submerged in the tub was the cause of the short circuit.
＃Protagonist
「……A snowdrop.」
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
＃Protagonist
「Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san……?」
＃Souko
「Likely so.」
＃Protagonist
「This flower is……?」
A single white flower was floating in the blood-red bathtub.
Why would it be in a place like this……
＃Souko
「It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall…… I wonder if the fact that only the flower head has fallen is a metaphor for the headless body……」
＃Protagonist
「……That's a gruesome thought.」
A snowdrop flower is floating in the tub.
＃Mikanagi
「……Let's wait until after we've pulled her out to perform the autopsy.」
＃Protagonist
「……You're right.」
……I'll leave the examination of the body for later.
＃Protagonist
「……The blood must have sprayed when the neck was cut.」
＃Souko
「But…… the head is missing again.」
＃Protagonist
「Did they take it with them……?」
＃Souko
「I don't understand the reason. Unless this body belongs to someone other than Ai-san.」
＃Mikanagi
「……I'm certain it's Ai-san. I've examined her before, so I wouldn't mistake her.」
＃Protagonist
「I see……」
……They likely decapitated her here.
