I searched the area, but I couldn't find anything resembling a key.
Is this... an organ?
I don't really know the difference between a piano and an organ.
Well, it's clearly a keyboard instrument.
I thought about trying to play it for a second, but it's probably not a good idea to touch things without permission.
It appears to be an organ.
There's some sheet music sitting on the desk.
It looks like something Kousei-san was in the middle of writing.
I don't know much about it, but maybe it's something valuable.
The title is... 'Three Fragments', perhaps?
It seems to be a piece of music titled 'Three Fragments'.
The glass cabinet appears to be filled with sheet music.
There are scores from composers even I recognize, like Beethoven and Bach.
A large collection of sheet music is stored here.
Is this... a music stand?
Kousei-san probably used it.
I've already finished searching here, so let's look elsewhere.
Sheet music is pasted onto the wall.
It was likely composed by Kousei-san.
Sheet music is pasted onto the wall.
The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A book has been left lying on the music stand.
It's almost as if Kousei-san were still alive.
It looks like musical reference material.
Inside the desk drawer, I found some blank staff paper.
A small wood fragment is being used as a paperweight.
What is this...? It looks like a piece of parquetry.

"...I suppose I'll hang onto this for now."
Unused staff paper is stored here.
It looks like a portrait.
I don't know the artist, but it's likely a foreign work.
A portrait is on display.
