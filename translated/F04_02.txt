I’ve arrived at the first-floor hall.
It seems like no one is here.
I'll head somewhere else.
Benio-san and Shion-san were in the hall.
＃Benio
「Is it still not fixed?」
That was the first thing she said the moment she saw my face.
＃Protagonist
「Telling me that doesn't exactly help matters.」
＃Shion
「...It’s so dark, I can't find anything to do.」
＃Benio
「Good grief... what is Tsujimura doing?」
Benio-san crossed her arms.
It didn't feel like the kind of atmosphere where I could strike up a conversation.
＃Protagonist
「...Well then, I’ll be going.」
I hurriedly left the area.
Benio-san and Shion-san were in the hall.
＃Benio
「Is it still not fixed?」
＃Protagonist
「I told you, please don't rush me...」
I hurried away, trying to distance myself from the clearly irritated Benio-san.
＃Protagonist
「Please wait just a little longer. I’m going to go look for a fuse now.」
Recalling that Tsujimura-san had asked me to do it, I hurried toward the storage room.
＃Protagonist
「I found the fuse, so please bear with it for a while longer.」
After soothing the dissatisfied-looking Benio-san, I decided to patrol the manor just a bit more.
