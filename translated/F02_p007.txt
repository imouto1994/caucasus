"Takamine-san? He’s quite a stern man, isn't he? He doesn't look like a lawyer... then again, he didn't look like a priest, either."
#Protagonist
"Yeah."
#Maya
"Attorney Takamine's father was also the legal advisor for the Nanatsuki family. He is very dedicated to his work."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Ai
"I’ve heard Takamine-san has been coming here since he was a small child, brought along by his father."
#Protagonist
"Is that so?"
#Benio
"Takamine? I hear he’s been coming in and out of this place since before I was even born."
#Protagonist
"Is that so?"
#Tsujimura
"We intend to have Attorney Takamine manage the Master's estate and other matters as well."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Takamine
"...I have nothing to say to you."
#Protagonist
"Y-you're right..."
#御巫
"About Takamine-san? It seems his father was involved with this house as well, just like mine."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Akane
"Attorney Takamine...? I believe he’s likely in his room or the Great Hall..."
#Protagonist
"I see."

#Protagonist
"Y-you're right..."
