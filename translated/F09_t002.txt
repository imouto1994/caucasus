"...The fact the killer is losing their composure means we've likely cornered them. The suspects are narrowing down, and tonight will be the climax."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"How terrifying... who could have done such a thing..."
#Satoshi
"...I'm in the middle of investigating that right now."
#Ai
"...Why did such a thing have to happen to Kirihara-san...?"
#Satoshi
"I think it's because she was investigating..."
#Benio
"The reason her room was targeted... if it's because she was snooping around, that would apply to you as well. So there must be something else..."
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
#Shion
"Who could have done such a thing...?"
#Satoshi
"We don't... know yet."
#Tsujimura
"...Would it be all right if I washed that off...?"
#Satoshi
"I'm not sure... I'd certainly like to see it gone, though..."
#Takamine
"A warning...? It's far too late for that. I doubt it serves any real purpose."
#Satoshi
"Is that so...?"
#Mikanagi
"...It's undoubtedly blood. Whether it's Isamu's... or the killer's own blood... we won't know without a proper appraisal."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"...The killer warned her because Mistress Kirihara is snooping around, right? I don't think doing something like that will have any effect, though..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Narumi
"A warning written in blood, huh... the fact they'd go to the trouble of warning her means they're likely not done yet..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
