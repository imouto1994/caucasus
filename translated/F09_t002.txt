「...The fact the killer is losing their composure means we've likely cornered them. The suspects are narrowing down, and tonight will be the climax.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Maya
「How terrifying... who could have done such a thing...」
＃Protagonist
「...I'm in the middle of investigating that right now.」
＃Ai
「...Why did such a thing have to happen to Kirihara-san...?」
＃Protagonist
「I think it's because she was investigating...」
＃Benio
「The reason her room was targeted... if it's because she was snooping around, that would apply to you as well. So there must be something else...」
＃Protagonist
「I wonder...」
＃Shion
「Who could have done such a thing...?」
＃Protagonist
「We don't... know yet.」
＃Tsujimura
「...Would it be all right if I washed that off...?」
＃Protagonist
「I'm not sure... I'd certainly like to see it gone, though...」
＃Takamine
「A warning...? It's far too late for that. I doubt it serves any real purpose.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...?」
＃Mikanagi
「...It's undoubtedly blood. Whether it's Isamu's... or the killer's own blood... we won't know without a proper appraisal.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「...The killer warned her because Mistress Kirihara is snooping around, right? I don't think doing something like that will have any effect, though...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Narumi
「A warning written in blood, huh... the fact they'd go to the trouble of warning her means they're likely not done yet...」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe so...」
