I returned to the corridor in front of my room.
#Main Character
"Oh... Benio-san?"
Benio-san was standing in front of my room.
#Benio
"Nn... yeah."
#Main Character
"What happened?"
#Benio
"There’s something that’s still bothering me."
#Main Character
"Is it about what was written in Souko-san’s room earlier?"
#Benio
"That too... but come to my room for a moment."
#Main Character
"Sure, I don't mind..."
I entered Benio-san's room.
#Main Character
"So, what’s on your mind?"
#Benio
"...It’s about the heads."
#Main Character
"Heads...?"
#Benio
"Yes. When Rokuyou was killed, the head was missing, right?"
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Benio
"The meaning behind that still isn't clear. Nor where the head went..."
#Main Character
"The meaning, huh... When I talked about it with Souko-san before, she thought it might be related to the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'..."
#Benio
"...The 'Nanatsuki Sacrifice' might be closer."
#Main Character
"Sacrifice...?"
#Benio
"...The Nanatsuki family carries tainted blood. Apparently, there was a custom of decapitating daughters who showed abnormalities in order to purify the bloodline."
#Main Character
"That’s..."
#Benio
"Fortunately, it hasn't been practiced recently. If it were, I’d likely have been the first to go."
Benio-san gave a cynical laugh.
#Benio
"That’s why that strange custom from the other day came to be practiced for weddings."
#Main Character
"...You mean spending the night in the coffin?"
#Benio
"Exactly. It was meant to prove one’s innocence, but..."
#Main Character
"But... Rokuyou-san was killed."
#Benio
"...Shion has a weak constitution. That might be because of the tainted Nanatsuki blood... no, she’s adopted, so that shouldn't matter..."
#Main Character
"Um... who knows about the 'Nanatsuki Sacrifice'?"
#Benio
"Anyone in our family would know. It’s not something we want leaked to the outside, though."
#Main Character
"But... Rokuyou-san is a man. He wouldn't be a sacrifice."
#Benio
"True... it’s possible that instead of an actual sacrifice, someone who knows the story is imitating it."
#Main Character
"So they’re staging it to look like the 'Nanatsuki Sacrifice'...?"
#Benio
"Not necessarily. They might have just wanted to hide the head."
#Main Character
"...I’m not sure."
#Benio
"None of us are."
Benio-san lay down on her bed.
#Main Character
"I’ll go back to my room and think about it a bit more."
Given the time, it probably wasn't a good idea to stay in a woman’s room forever.
#Benio
"I see. ...Make sure you don't let your guard down."
#Main Character
"Yeah, I know."
#Benio
"...Hey."
#Main Character
"Yes?"
#Benio
"...You try lying down, too."
#Main Character
"...Uh, okay."
As instructed, I lay down next to Benio-san.
#Main Character
"Ouch!"
Our heads bumped together.
#Benio
"You idiot! Did you do that on purpose!?"
Sitting up and leaning over me, Benio-san grabbed my collar.
#Main Character
"N-No! I mean, please don't move around so much!"
#Benio
"Do you have a problem with it!?"
#Main Character
"No, well... when you move while straddling me, well..."
I’m a young man, after all; that kind of stimulation...
#Benio
"What about...!?"
Finally realizing, Benio-san suddenly went silent.
#Benio
"...Ah, uuh... it’s hitting me...?"
#Main Character
"...Well, that’s only natural after this much stimulation."
#Benio
"W-What should I do...?"
#Main Character
"Um..."
Benio-san’s face was bright red.
#Main Character
"W-What should we do..."
#Benio
"Well... if you just tell me, I’ll do it..."
#Main Character
"Uh... in that case..."
