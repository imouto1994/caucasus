「Excuse me.」
I called out before entering the infirmary, but Dr. Mikanagi wasn't there.
Is he still on the first floor?
If that’s the case, there's no point in staying here, but...
What should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Dr. Mikanagi.」
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what's up?」
＃Protagonist
「Um... do you have a moment?」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't mind.」
Now, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Do you have a moment?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, go ahead.」
Now, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
I called out before entering the infirmary, but Dr. Mikanagi wasn't there.
I wonder if he's out somewhere.
If that’s the case, there's no point in staying here, but...
What should I do?
