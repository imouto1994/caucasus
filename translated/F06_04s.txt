Several phone books are lined up.
There's one for the prefecture, and even one for Sendai City.
Phone books are placed here.

I wonder when this blizzard will let up...

There's a pencil for writing notes.
I wonder if Tsujimura-san was the one who kept it properly sharpened.
A pencil is placed here.
