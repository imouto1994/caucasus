I returned to the first floor.
＃Protagonist
"Then I'll go to Shion-san's place."
＃Narumi
"Will you be okay on your own?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... don't worry."
I entered the office.
＃Benio
"Nn... what's up?"
Benio-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Oh, Benio-san... you're still awake?"
＃Benio
"I couldn't sleep. Want some?"
She held up a cup of cocoa.
＃Protagonist
"No, I have things I need to confirm right now."
＃Benio
"...Shion?"
＃Protagonist
"...Yeah."
＃Benio
"...Did you find something out from the code Father left behind? But that was written a long time ago, wasn't it? It has nothing to do with the case—"
＃Protagonist
"It was related."
＃Benio
"What...?"
＃Protagonist
"...I heard that a woman named Akari Misono used to work here."
＃Benio
"Ah... she seemed to be close with the doctor... but she disappeared suddenly."
＃Protagonist
"Apparently, she was Akane-san's older sister."
＃Benio
"...Is that so... but does that matter now...? Even with Akane being missing..."
＃Protagonist
"It's Akari Misono-san. I asked you about her earlier, remember?"
＃Benio
"...Yeah. But why would she be here...?"
＃Protagonist
"...A short while ago, I confirmed a skeletal corpse in the basement that appears to be Akari-san."
＃Benio
"What—!? What do you mean!?"
＃Protagonist
"...She didn't disappear; she was murdered."
＃Benio
"That's impossible... then, who are you saying is the culprit...?"
＃Protagonist
"...I think you already know, Benio-san..."
＃Benio
"...Mother...? And the reason?"
I handed Kousei-san's journal to Benio-san.
＃Benio
"This is..."
Benio-san gasped lightly and then began to read in silence.
＃Protagonist
"...I am certain that what is written here is the truth."
＃Benio
"I don't want to believe it... but it's likely true."
Benio-san let out a sigh.
＃Benio
"Still, to think... that Sister and I were not Father's children after all."
＃Protagonist
"Benio-san..."
＃Benio
"There's no point in saying anything now. ...I suppose this is why the inheritance was so skewed."
＃Protagonist
"You mean the fact that Shion-san inherits nothing."
＃Benio
"Father likely wanted to protect Shion. So he made sure she wouldn't be caught up in anything related to the inheritance."
＃Protagonist
"But... Rokuyou-san tried to marry Shion-san. Why was that?"
＃Mikanagi
"—I'll speak to that."
＃Benio
"Doctor...?"
Dr. Mikanagi was standing in the doorway of the office.
＃Mikanagi
"I believe my father was involved. My father... was on bad terms with the Rokuyou family, who are also distant relatives of the Nanatsukis."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so?"
＃Mikanagi
"It doesn't have much to do with our generation. But my father often grumbled about it. That it would be unforgivable for a member of the Rokuyou family to enter the Nanatsuki house."
＃Benio
"And so he recommended Shion to Rokuyou?"
＃Mikanagi
"...I believe so. Although... it might have been that he couldn't forgive his own daughter marrying a member of the Rokuyou family even more."
＃Benio
"...I see."
＃Mikanagi
"Besides, to work on a global scale, the name of the composer Kousei Tsujimura would be more useful."
＃Benio
"...The Nanatsuki name only carries weight in this region, after all. And Shion's mother's family is also famous, right?"
＃Mikanagi
"I don't know if he knew that much. Plus, there might be rights to Mr. Kousei's musical compositions."
＃Benio
"Still, even so... that doesn't explain why Rokuyou was killed."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... that's why I'm going to go talk to Shion-san now."
＃Benio
"Do you think Shion is the culprit?"
＃Protagonist
"...I think the possibility is high."
＃Protagonist
"...Yes, I have proof."
＃Benio
"I see... then let's go."
Benio-san headed for the back door.
＃Protagonist
"Um... Dr. Mikanagi."
＃Mikanagi
"Yes?"
＃Protagonist
"How long... were you listening to us?"
＃Mikanagi
"...Akari's matter isn't something you should worry about. Thank you for finding her. Please guide me there later."
Dr. Mikanagi lightly patted my head and then followed Benio-san outside.
