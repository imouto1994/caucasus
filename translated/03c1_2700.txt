I returned to the first floor.
#Main Character
"Then I'll go to Shion-san's place."
#Narumi
"Will you be okay on your own?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... don't worry."
I entered the office.
#Benio
"Nn... what's up?"
Benio-san was there.
#Main Character
"Oh, Benio-san... you're still awake?"
#Benio
"I couldn't sleep. Want some?"
She held up a cup of cocoa.
#Main Character
"No, I have things I need to confirm right now."
#Benio
"...Shion?"
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
#Benio
"...Did you find something out from the code Father left behind? But that was written a long time ago, wasn't it? It has nothing to do with the case—"
#Main Character
"It was related."
#Benio
"What...?"
#Main Character
"...I heard that a woman named Akari Misono used to work here."
#Benio
"Ah... she seemed to be close with the doctor... but she disappeared suddenly."
#Main Character
"Apparently, she was Akane-san's older sister."
#Benio
"...Is that so... but does that matter now...? Even with Akane being missing..."
#Main Character
"It's Akari Misono-san. I asked you about her earlier, remember?"
#Benio
"...Yeah. But why would she be here...?"
#Main Character
"...A short while ago, I confirmed a skeletal corpse in the basement that appears to be Akari-san."
#Benio
"What—!? What do you mean!?"
#Main Character
"...She didn't disappear; she was murdered."
#Benio
"That's impossible... then, who are you saying is the culprit...?"
#Main Character
"...I think you already know, Benio-san..."
#Benio
"...Mother...? And the reason?"
I handed Kousei-san's journal to Benio-san.
#Benio
"This is..."
Benio-san gasped lightly and then began to read in silence.
#Main Character
"...I am certain that what is written here is the truth."
#Benio
"I don't want to believe it... but it's likely true."
Benio-san let out a sigh.
#Benio
"Still, to think... that Sister and I were not Father's children after all."
#Main Character
"Benio-san..."
#Benio
"There's no point in saying anything now. ...I suppose this is why the inheritance was so skewed."
#Main Character
"You mean the fact that Shion-san inherits nothing."
#Benio
"Father likely wanted to protect Shion. So he made sure she wouldn't be caught up in anything related to the inheritance."
#Main Character
"But... Rokuyou-san tried to marry Shion-san. Why was that?"
#Mikanagi
"—I'll speak to that."
#Benio
"Doctor...?"
Dr. Mikanagi was standing in the doorway of the office.
#Mikanagi
"I believe my father was involved. My father... was on bad terms with the Rokuyou family, who are also distant relatives of the Nanatsukis."
#Main Character
"Is that so?"
#Mikanagi
"It doesn't have much to do with our generation. But my father often grumbled about it. That it would be unforgivable for a member of the Rokuyou family to enter the Nanatsuki house."
#Benio
"And so he recommended Shion to Rokuyou?"
#Mikanagi
"...I believe so. Although... it might have been that he couldn't forgive his own daughter marrying a member of the Rokuyou family even more."
#Benio
"...I see."
#Mikanagi
"Besides, to work on a global scale, the name of the composer Kousei Tsujimura would be more useful."
#Benio
"...The Nanatsuki name only carries weight in this region, after all. And Shion's mother's family is also famous, right?"
#Mikanagi
"I don't know if he knew that much. Plus, there might be rights to Mr. Kousei's musical compositions."
#Benio
"Still, even so... that doesn't explain why Rokuyou was killed."
#Main Character
"Yeah... that's why I'm going to go talk to Shion-san now."
#Benio
"Do you think Shion is the culprit?"
#Main Character
"...I think the possibility is high."
#Main Character
"...Yes, I have proof."
#Benio
"I see... then let's go."
Benio-san headed for the back door.
#Main Character
"Um... Dr. Mikanagi."
#Mikanagi
"Yes?"
#Main Character
"How long... were you listening to us?"
#Mikanagi
"...Akari's matter isn't something you should worry about. Thank you for finding her. Please guide me there later."
Dr. Mikanagi lightly patted my head and then followed Benio-san outside.
