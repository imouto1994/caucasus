This is Mikanagi-sensei's room.
I knock lightly on the door.

"Mikanagi-sensei, are you there?"
The door opens, and Mikanagi-sensei peeks his head out.
#Mikanagi
"Oh, it's you."
#Satoshi
"Hello, Mikanagi-sensei. Um... have you seen Kirihara?"
#Mikanagi
"I've been back in my room since I parted ways with you earlier. Before that... I saw her on the first floor after six."
#Satoshi
"And after that?"
#Mikanagi
"I predictably wouldn't know. There was nothing strange about her, though..."
#Satoshi
"I see... Thank you very much."
I thanked him and decided to go somewhere else.
This is Mikanagi-sensei's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
The door opens, and Mikanagi-sensei peeks his head out.
#Mikanagi
"Oh... have you still not found Kirihara-san?"
#Satoshi
"No..."
#Mikanagi
"I wonder where on earth she could have gone..."
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll try looking a bit more."
#Mikanagi
"Yeah, be careful, you never know what might happen."
This is Mikanagi-sensei's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
However, there was no response from inside.
Maybe he's not there.
I gave up and decided to go somewhere else.
