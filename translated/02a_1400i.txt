＃Souko
"I think that's enough for now."
The clock struck two, and Souko-san brought the meeting to a close.
＃Protagonist
"...Did you find anything out?"
＃Souko
"That’s my line."
Souko-san said with a wry smile.
＃Souko
"But well... if I had to give my own impression, there wasn't anything that counts as decisive evidence."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Souko
"A delayed-action murder attempt using the clock mechanism—no one had a solid alibi during the window when it was likely set up. That includes you and me, for that matter."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
＃Souko
"Now we just have to wait and see if Ai-san saw the killer’s face—but we can't confirm that until she regains consciousness."
＃Protagonist
"We'll have to leave that for later, then."
＃Souko
"Right. To summarize where we are: finding the killer is going to be difficult. So, let’s try thinking about it from the perspective of motive."
＃Protagonist
"Motive, huh? The reason someone would kill Rokuyou-san and try to kill Ai-san..."
＃Benio
"—It’s about the inheritance, obviously."
＃Protagonist
"Whoa!?"
Benio-san suddenly interjected from behind us.
＃Benio
"Of course, that makes me the primary suspect, doesn't it?"
Benio-san gave a mocking laugh.
＃Souko
"...Do you want the inheritance that badly?"
＃Benio
"Didn't I tell you this morning? I have no interest in it."
Benio-san continued.
＃Benio
"Though, even if I have no interest, I'll still receive my share as long as I'm an eligible heir."
＃Souko
"...It seems wise to keep the possibility of an inheritance-related crime in mind."
＃Protagonist
"But if that's the case—"
I looked at Benio-san.
＃Benio
"What is it?"
＃Protagonist
"...I think it’s highly likely that Benio-san will be the next victim."
＃Souko
"You're right... either her or Shion-san."
＃Benio
"Hmm... that’s not a very pleasant thought."
Benio-san crossed her arms.
＃Protagonist
"Please, be extremely careful, Benio-san."
＃Benio
"I know, I know."
＃Souko
"By the way, who do you think is the killer at this point?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... me...?"
＃Souko
"Of course, we can't tell anyone else right now. We don't want to breed any unnecessary suspicion. But... I want to know where you stand."
＃Benio
"Hmm... she's right. I'd love to hear your brilliant reasoning. I don't mind even if you point the finger at me."
＃Protagonist
"Well... let's see..."
＃Souko
"Me? Why?"
＃Protagonist
"Now, don't get angry, okay?"
＃Souko
"It's your opinion, so I'm not going to get upset, but..."
＃Protagonist
"It's simply because you don't have an alibi..."
＃Souko
"Maya-san, eh... I wonder."
＃Benio
"...If we're talking about inheritance, it’s not outside the realm of possibility. The fewer heirs there are, the larger her own share becomes."
＃Protagonist
"...Though it doesn't seem very realistic, I suppose."
＃Souko
"...Are you suggesting Ai-san set the whole thing up herself?"
＃Protagonist
"I can't say the possibility is zero. After all, Ai-san didn't actually die..."
＃Benio
"...Wouldn't she have certainly died if you hadn't come to her rescue? No one would take such a high-risk gamble, would they?"
＃Protagonist
"I suppose you're right..."
＃Benio
"...Hmm, you make a fair point. If you consider it from the perspective of inheritance, it's not entirely inconceivable."
＃Protagonist
"I'm just discussing the possibilities, okay? Please don't get mad."
＃Benio
"I'm not mad."
＃Protagonist
"You clearly are..."
＃Souko
"Shion-san, eh... She and Ai-san seemed to get along well, but I wonder..."
＃Benio
"There's no proof... but she might have a motive, just like me."
＃Protagonist
"Exactly..."
＃Benio
"Tsujimura, huh... It's not impossible, I suppose..."
＃Souko
"Since he's Kousei-shi's younger brother, there might be a chance for him to inherit... but I have to wonder if a man like him would really come up with something like this."
＃Benio
"I'm inclined to agree with you on that."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Souko
"...Listen, Rokuyou-san is already dead."
＃Benio
"Are you suggesting he’s risen from the grave?"
＃Protagonist
"No, I’m just saying... it’s a possibility."
＃Souko
"If that corpse isn't Rokuyou-san, then who on earth is it?"
＃Protagonist
"Well... sorry, I was wrong."
＃Benio
"Get a grip, honestly..."
＃Benio
"So Takamine is the killer... He did claim to be holed up in his room the entire time, it’s true..."
＃Souko
"But there isn't a shred of evidence. ...Honestly, I'm glad he isn't here to hear this."
＃Benio
"No kidding. He'd probably punch you if he heard that."
＃Protagonist
"You're probably right..."
＃Benio
"...If Hakase were the killer, that would be a nightmare. We wouldn't be able to trust anything."
＃Souko
"...True. Forget the autopsy—we wouldn't even be able to take medicine if we felt sick."
＃Protagonist
"That's a scary thought..."
＃Souko
"Wasn't Akane-san with you the whole time?"
＃Protagonist
"...But couldn't you argue that was just a convenient excuse to establish an alibi?"
＃Souko
"You're free to think what you like, but... if that were the case, there's no way Ai-san would have survived."
＃Benio
"True. No one would go to the trouble of faking their own suspicion only to fail to finish the job."
＃Protagonist
"I-I guess so..."
＃Benio
"The thought of Narumi being the killer is terrifying. I'd never be able to finish a meal again."
＃Souko
"That’s true... so, are you saying you won't eat anything Narumi-san makes?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... how did we get to that?"
＃Benio
"Because there's a chance she could poison us, isn't there? If you really can't stand the thought, I guess you'll just have to cook for yourself."
＃Protagonist
"That sounds rough..."
＃Souko
"In the end, since we don't know who the killer is, our only defense is self-preservation."
＃Protagonist
"...Right."
