When I entered the grand hall, Mikanagi-sensei was drinking tea.
＃Protagonist
"Oh, that's rare for you."
＃Mikanagi
"I don't spend *all* my time cooped up in the infirmary, you know."
＃Protagonist
"No, I didn't mean it like that, but..."
＃Mikanagi
"Hahaha... By the way, do you need something?"
Mikanagi-sensei was still in the grand hall.
＃Mikanagi
"Oh, do you still need something from me?"
Akane-san and Mikanagi-sensei were in the grand hall.
I wonder which one I should talk to...
There was no one in the grand hall.
Well... what should I do?
When I entered the grand hall, Akane-san was there.
＃Akane
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm just doing a quick patrol of the mansion..."
＃Akane
"I see. Thank you for your hard work."
＃Protagonist
"Has anything unusual happened?"
＃Akane
"No, nothing in particular..."
＃Protagonist
"I see... We don't know what might happen, so please be careful, Akane-san."
＃Akane
"Yes, I understand."
When I entered the grand hall, Akane-san was still there.
＃Akane
"Ah, is something wrong?"
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
In the grand hall, Takamine-san was drinking coffee alone.
＃Protagonist
"Ah, Takamine-san."
＃Takamine
"What is it...?"
He gives me a sharp, sideways glare.
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
Entering the grand hall, I locked eyes with Takamine-san.
＃Takamine
"...What?"
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
