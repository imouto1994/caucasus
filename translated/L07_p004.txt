"If she was killed in the music room, she should have passed right by my door, but I didn't notice a thing. If so, it must have been after midnight when I was asleep..."

#Maya
"Why Benio too... for what reason...?"
#Satoshi
"...That is what I am investigating right now."
#Ai
"Why did Benio have to be killed!? Come on, tell me!"
#Satoshi
"I don't... know yet..."
#Shion
"Lady Benio... why...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Tsujimura
"Even Lady Benio... just what is going on...?"
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Takamine
"If Benio-kun was killed during the night... I doubt there would be any witnesses or anything..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
#Mikanagi
"...Considering Benio-san's body wasn't discovered until morning, it'll be difficult to find any witnesses from before the crime was committed..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Akane
"Just what could Lady Benio have possibly done...!?"
#Satoshi
"I feel... exactly the same way..."
#Narumi
"To think even Lady Benio was targeted... I didn't think she was the type to die so easily..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
