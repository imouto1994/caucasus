I've returned to the hall.
I turn my head at the sound of a bell.
A black cat is looking down at me from halfway up the stairs.
#Protagonist
"Love……?"
It's not as if it responded to my call.
The black cat is looking up toward the second floor.
Benio-san is standing at the top of the stairs.
#Benio
"So this is where you were."
I wonder which of us those words were addressed to, me or the cat.
#Benio
"Was Shion safe?"
She speaks to me as she picks up the black cat and walks down the stairs.
#Protagonist
"Yeah……"
#Benio
"I see."
#Protagonist
"It's dangerous for you too, Benio-san, so please stay quiet in your room."
#Benio
"I know. But wouldn't it be safer if I were with you?"
#Protagonist
"……Is that because you think I'm not the culprit?"
#Benio
"There's no evidence that you aren't the culprit. But that's not it, I just feel at ease when you're nearby."
#Protagonist
"……Are you serious?"
#Benio
"Of course I am, don't you think?"
Benio-san smiles.
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and Tsujimura-san appears.
#Tsujimura
"Oh, Miss Benio."
#Benio
"……Tsujimura, were you listening?"
#Tsujimura
"Whatever do you mean?"
He doesn't look like he's feigning ignorance.
He was likely tinkering with the generator in the basement.
#Benio
"……Never mind, don't worry about it."
#Tsujimura
"As you wish."
Tsujimura-san bows.
#Benio
"I'm going back to my room."
Leaving only those words, Benio-san heads back up the stairs holding the black cat.
#Tsujimura
"……Do you have a moment?"
#Protagonist
"Eh, me?"
Called out to suddenly, I turn to face Tsujimura-san.
#Tsujimura
"It wouldn't do to talk here, so shall we head to the office?"
#Protagonist
"Eh, yeah. I don't mind."
#Tsujimura
"Then, this way."
I follow Tsujimura-san to the office.
