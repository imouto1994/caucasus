"...There's a high probability Rokuyou-san was killed at that time."
#Protagonist
"...You're right."
#Maya
"...Was Isamu-san killed around then...?"
#Protagonist
"It's possible."
#Benio
"...It was late at night. If Rokuyou was killed then, most people have no alibi..."
#Protagonist
"That's true..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"...If I had taken your words to heart and checked properly at that time, we might not have fallen into such chaos..."
#Protagonist
"That might be true, but..."
#Takamine
"...The walls here are thick. You wouldn't hear much across the corridor."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"...I expect yours was the only room where it could be heard. Isamu's room was directly below."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Narumi
"To think that was the sound of a throat being cut..."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
