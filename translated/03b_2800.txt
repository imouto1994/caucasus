I returned to the office.
#Souko
"Tsujimura-san isn't here, so this will do."
#Main Character
"What are you going to do now?"
#Souko
"...Let's verify the facts regarding Shion-san's case. Was it a murder... or was it Shion-san's suicide—"
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Well then, first—who do you think is the culprit?"
#Main Character
"Souko-san... where were you after 2:30?"
#Souko
"So you suspect me. Fine... I was in my room. There's no one who can prove it... is that enough?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... at this hour, no one has an alibi anyway."
#Souko
"I suppose that's true. In that case, shouldn't we try attacking it from a different angle?"
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Main Character
"...From 2:00 to 2:30, I was talking with Shion-san."
#Souko
"That's right. But because of that, there's a possibility you could be seen as the culprit."
#Main Character
"I know. But—when I came out, Maya-san was here in this office. She was bringing Shion-san's medicine."
#Souko
"...Meaning the possibility that the medicine was poison."
#Main Character
"Yes. It wouldn't be unreasonable."
#Souko
"Right... I think that's the most likely scenario."
#Main Character
"But... why? Is it because she's an adoptee after all—"
#Souko
"More than that, isn't there the reason you went to see Shion-san?"
#Main Character
"...The murder of Dr. Mikanagi."
#Souko
"In my estimation, Dr. Mikanagi was Maya-san's lover. He seemed to visit her room often, so it's not surprising."
#Main Character
"And so, when Dr. Mikanagi was killed—"
#Souko
"It's not just that. Ai-san and Benio-san were killed as well."
#Souko
"It's not just that. Benio-san was killed as well."
#Souko
"The culprit hasn't been identified, but she might have convinced herself that Shion-san was behind everything."
#Main Character
"...That's just depressing."
#Souko
"True... however, we still need some kind of definitive proof."
#Main Character
"I suppose so..."
#Main Character
"...After all, the circumstance of her bringing the medicine is the most suspicious. The cup was left behind too, and if we start from there—"
#Souko
"So you think Shion-san's attempted poisoning this morning was indeed a suicide attempt?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... no matter how hard potassium cyanide is to drink, isn't it more likely she was forced to drink it?"
#Souko
"Right... even if forced, it would be difficult for Shion-san, who feels a sense of debt, to refuse..."
#Main Character
"...Let's go. I think it's almost certain that Maya-san killed Shion-san."
#Souko
"Yes, I understand."
#Main Character
"...Don't you think it was Ai-san?"
#Souko
"Ai-san? But she's already dead. I don't see how she could have faked it..."
#Main Character
"I see..."
#Souko
"Ai-san, hmm... and your reason?"
#Main Character
"Well... I don't really have one..."
#Souko
"Then it's no good. You have to be able to present proper evidence."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Main Character
"What about the possibility of Benio-san...?"
#Souko
"That's impossible. She's already dead, and even with the head missing, in that situation, you can't even suspect it was a fake."
#Main Character
"I see..."
#Main Character
"...The possibility of Shion-san's suicide still remains."
#Souko
"Right... it can't be ruled out entirely. But why?"
#Main Character
"It might be because I pushed her too hard regarding Dr. Mikanagi's case. Given the circumstances, I didn't think it could be anyone but her..."
#Souko
"And so, unable to bear it, she committed suicide... or perhaps she fell into despair after being suspected..."
#Main Character
"I... I'm no longer sure if Shion-san really killed Dr. Mikanagi."
#Souko
"I see..."
#Main Character
"...Should we just settle on suicide...?"
#Souko
"...If no other evidence turns up, I suppose that's how it'll go."
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
#Main Character
"Is there a possibility that Tsujimura-san killed her?"
#Souko
"...Certainly, Tsujimura-san is always in this office, and he could have gone to Shion-san's place without anyone noticing... but why?"
#Main Character
"Well... I don't know the reason."
#Souko
"You shouldn't suspect someone when there's no reason."
#Main Character
"...You're right."
#Main Character
"Maybe Rokuyou-san—"
#Souko
"That's not it."
She denied it flatly.
#Main Character
"T-True..."
#Main Character
"Is there a possibility of Takamine-san?"
#Souko
"Takamine-san, huh... he doesn't really fit the image of a poisoner..."
#Main Character
"Still, he's a lawyer, so he must have some education."
#Souko
"Knowledge of the law and knowledge of drugs are entirely different things. Besides, I see absolutely no reason for him to kill Shion-san."
#Main Character
"I-I see..."
#Main Character
"What about the possibility that Dr. Mikanagi planted the poison? If he set it up in advance, he could kill the target without doing anything himself..."
#Souko
"If it's just the possibility, it wouldn't be strange. But... Dr. Mikanagi has already been killed, you know?"
#Main Character
"That's why I'm saying he set it up before he was killed. That way... it's possible to carry it out even after death."
#Souko
"Then what's the reason for killing Shion-san? There's absolutely nothing. Surely you aren't thinking that he predicted his own murder?"
#Main Character
"Of... of course not..."
#Main Character
"What about... Akane-san?"
#Souko
"I wonder. I don't see any reason for her to kill Shion-san..."
#Main Character
"Akane-san seemed to be in love with Dr. Mikanagi. So... couldn't it be that she carried out her revenge?"
#Souko
"In this short amount of time? I think that's a bit of a stretch."
#Main Character
"I see..."
#Main Character
"Is there a possibility it was Narumi-san?"
#Souko
"...I wonder. There doesn't seem to be a motive. Though there might be things we don't know."
#Main Character
"I'm not really sure..."
#Souko
"...We can't really narrow it down at this stage, can we?"
Souko-san muttered with a sigh.
#Main Character
"What do we do now...?"
#Souko
"Right... dawn is almost here, so let's just stay quiet for a while. Once the people from below arrive, we can have them call the police."
#Main Character
"You're right... then I'll head back to my room for now."
#Souko
"Yeah. ...Make sure you lock the door."
#Main Character
"I know."
