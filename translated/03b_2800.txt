I returned to the office.
＃Souko
「Tsujimura-san isn't here, so this will do.」
＃Protagonist
「What are you going to do now?」
＃Souko
「...Let's verify the facts regarding Shion-san's case. Was it a murder... or was it Shion-san's suicide?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Souko
「Well then, first?who do you think is the culprit?」
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san... where were you after 2:30?」
＃Souko
「So you suspect me. Fine... I was in my room. There's no one who can prove it... is that enough?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... at this hour, no one has an alibi anyway.」
＃Souko
「I suppose that's true. In that case, shouldn't we try attacking it from a different angle?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Protagonist
「...From 2:00 to 2:30, I was talking with Shion-san.」
＃Souko
「That's right. But because of that, there's a possibility you could be seen as the culprit.」
＃Protagonist
「I know. But?when I came out, Maya-san was here in this office. She was bringing Shion-san's medicine.」
＃Souko
「...Meaning the possibility that the medicine was poison.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes. It wouldn't be unreasonable.」
＃Souko
「Right... I think that's the most likely scenario.」
＃Protagonist
「But... why? Is it because she's an adoptee after all?」
＃Souko
「More than that, isn't there the reason you went to see Shion-san?」
＃Protagonist
「...The murder of Dr. Mikanagi.」
＃Souko
「In my estimation, Dr. Mikanagi was Maya-san's lover. He seemed to visit her room often, so it's not surprising.」
＃Protagonist
「And so, when Dr. Mikanagi was killed?」
＃Souko
「It's not just that. Ai-san and Benio-san were killed as well.」
＃Souko
「It's not just that. Benio-san was killed as well.」
＃Souko
「The culprit hasn't been identified, but she might have convinced herself that Shion-san was behind everything.」
＃Protagonist
「...That's just depressing.」
＃Souko
「True... however, we still need some kind of definitive proof.」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
＃Protagonist
「...After all, the circumstance of her bringing the medicine is the most suspicious. The cup was left behind too, and if we start from there?」
＃Souko
「So you think Shion-san's attempted poisoning this morning was indeed a suicide attempt?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... no matter how hard potassium cyanide is to drink, isn't it more likely she was forced to drink it?」
＃Souko
「Right... even if forced, it would be difficult for Shion-san, who feels a sense of debt, to refuse...」
＃Protagonist
「...Let's go. I think it's almost certain that Maya-san killed Shion-san.」
＃Souko
「Yes, I understand.」
＃Protagonist
「...Don't you think it was Ai-san?」
＃Souko
「Ai-san? But she's already dead. I don't see how she could have faked it...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Souko
「Ai-san, hmm... and your reason?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... I don't really have one...」
＃Souko
「Then it's no good. You have to be able to present proper evidence.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Protagonist
「What about the possibility of Benio-san...?」
＃Souko
「That's impossible. She's already dead, and even with the head missing, in that situation, you can't even suspect it was a fake.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「...The possibility of Shion-san's suicide still remains.」
＃Souko
「Right... it can't be ruled out entirely. But why?」
＃Protagonist
「It might be because I pushed her too hard regarding Dr. Mikanagi's case. Given the circumstances, I didn't think it could be anyone but her...」
＃Souko
「And so, unable to bear it, she committed suicide... or perhaps she fell into despair after being suspected...」
＃Protagonist
「I... I'm no longer sure if Shion-san really killed Dr. Mikanagi.」
＃Souko
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「...Should we just settle on suicide...?」
＃Souko
「...If no other evidence turns up, I suppose that's how it'll go.」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Protagonist
「Is there a possibility that Tsujimura-san killed her?」
＃Souko
「...Certainly, Tsujimura-san is always in this office, and he could have gone to Shion-san's place without anyone noticing... but why?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... I don't know the reason.」
＃Souko
「You shouldn't suspect someone when there's no reason.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe Rokuyou-san?」
＃Souko
「That's not it.」
She denied it flatly.
＃Protagonist
「T-True...」
＃Protagonist
「Is there a possibility of Takamine-san?」
＃Souko
「Takamine-san, huh... he doesn't really fit the image of a poisoner...」
＃Protagonist
「Still, he's a lawyer, so he must have some education.」
＃Souko
「Knowledge of the law and knowledge of drugs are entirely different things. Besides, I see absolutely no reason for him to kill Shion-san.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
＃Protagonist
「What about the possibility that Dr. Mikanagi planted the poison? If he set it up in advance, he could kill the target without doing anything himself...」
＃Souko
「If it's just the possibility, it wouldn't be strange. But... Dr. Mikanagi has already been killed, you know?」
＃Protagonist
「That's why I'm saying he set it up before he was killed. That way... it's possible to carry it out even after death.」
＃Souko
「Then what's the reason for killing Shion-san? There's absolutely nothing. Surely you aren't thinking that he predicted his own murder?」
＃Protagonist
「Of... of course not...」
＃Protagonist
「What about... Akane-san?」
＃Souko
「I wonder. I don't see any reason for her to kill Shion-san...」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san seemed to be in love with Dr. Mikanagi. So... couldn't it be that she carried out her revenge?」
＃Souko
「In this short amount of time? I think that's a bit of a stretch.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「Is there a possibility it was Narumi-san?」
＃Souko
「...I wonder. There doesn't seem to be a motive. Though there might be things we don't know.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm not really sure...」
＃Souko
「...We can't really narrow it down at this stage, can we?」
Souko-san muttered with a sigh.
＃Protagonist
「What do we do now...?」
＃Souko
「Right... dawn is almost here, so let's just stay quiet for a while. Once the people from below arrive, we can have them call the police.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right... then I'll head back to my room for now.」
＃Souko
「Yeah. ...Make sure you lock the door.」
＃Protagonist
「I know.」
