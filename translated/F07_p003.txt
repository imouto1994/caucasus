"...She seems quite distressed, doesn't she?"
#Satoshi
"...Yeah."
#Souko
"If Ai-san being targeted is related to the inheritance, those left behind would be the most suspicious... but I don't think it's quite that simple."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"I'm glad Ai survived, but... why must this happen..."
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Maya
"Why Ai, too...? Are you saying that child did something wrong...?"
#Satoshi
"Maya-san..."
#Ai
"...It feels like I can't shake this exhaustion... It's strange, isn't it? I should be in my own home..."
#Satoshi
"Ai-san..."
#Shion
"...I'm truly glad that Lady Ai is safe."
#Satoshi
"Me too..."
#Shion
"Why would someone do this to Lady Ai...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Ai seems to be quite worn down. It's only natural after what happened, but..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Tsujimura
"...Why did someone try to kill Lady Ai...?"
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Takamine
"...At any rate, I'm glad Ai-kun didn't lose her life."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Takamine
"...So even Ai-kun was murdered..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Mikanagi
"Ai-san should be back in her room. Given what happened yesterday, she ought to keep resting for now."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"What could the killer be aiming for...? What's to be gained by killing Isamu and Ai-san...?"
#Satoshi
"And Benio-san as well..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Akane
"I believe Lady Ai is in her room, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"To think even Lady Ai would be murdered... what on earth is happening...?"
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Narumi
"Lady Ai hasn't been herself since yesterday... though I guess that's to be expected."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Narumi
"The reason Lady Ai died, huh... only the killer knows that."
#Satoshi
"True..."
