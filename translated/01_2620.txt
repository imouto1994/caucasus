It happened just as I was heading up the stairs.
＃Benio
「Hm??」
Benio-san was standing there.
＃Protagonist
「Ah, Benio-san?」
＃Benio
「What were you doing?」
Benio-san cut me off with a question.
＃Protagonist
「Eh, what was I...? I was just talking to Tsujimura-san.」
＃Benio
「To Tsujimura? ...I see.」
＃Protagonist
「Um, is something wrong?」
＃Benio
「No, it's nothing.」
Benio-san shook her head, her tone still blunt.
I felt like her eyes were a bit glazed.
＃Protagonist
「Are you... tired?」
＃Benio
「Why do you insist on asking the obvious? Is there anyone who wouldn't be tired at this hour?」
＃Protagonist
「Y-yeah, I guess you're right...」
Then why was she out in the hallway?
＃Benio
「Sigh... well, sorry for bothering you.」
Benio-san walked around the atrium and disappeared into the east hallway.
＃Protagonist
「...Ah, I see.」
The restroom was only on that side, after all.
