"Oh, is something the matter?"
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san... have you seen Souko-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Mistress Kirihara? I remember her being in the grand hall about an hour ago, but..."
#Protagonist
"...I see."
#Tsujimura
"Was there anything else?"
#Protagonist
"No, I don't have any other business. I'll see you later."
#Tsujimura
"Yes. ...Please be careful."
Tsujimura-san saw me off as I left the office.
#Tsujimura
"Oh... have you still not found Mistress Kirihara?"
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
#Protagonist
"No..."
#Tsujimura
"I see... That's worrying."
#Protagonist
"Yeah... I'll try looking a bit more."
I decided to look elsewhere and left the office.
