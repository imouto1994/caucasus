When I entered the main hall with the now-changed Benio-san, Ai-san, who was sitting on the sofa, looked up.
#Ai
"Good morning."
#Main Character
"Good morning, Ai-san. Were you able to sleep last night?"
#Ai
"Yes, thanks to you."
Ai-san bowed her head.
#Benio
"Are you sure it's okay for you to be out here?"
#Ai
"...If I stay cooped up in my room alone, I'll only end up feeling more depressed."
Ai-san managed a smile.
#Ai
"I'll go make some cocoa."
#Main Character
"Thank you."
Almost as soon as Ai-san stood up, Akane-san and Narumi-san entered the room.
I arrived at the main hall with the now-changed Benio-san.
#Benio
"Do you want some cocoa?"
Benio-san asked me.
#Main Character
"Yes."
#Benio
"Wait a second."
Almost as soon as Benio-san walked to the corner of the room, Akane-san and Narumi-san entered.
#Akane
"Good morning, everyone."
#Main Character
"Ah, good morning."
#Narumi
"I've brought breakfast."
Narumi-san pushed in a cart lined with sandwiches.
#Souko
"May I have some?"
Souko-san, who had followed them in, poked her head out.
#Narumi
"Go ahead. ...Well, if anyone doesn't want to eat, I won't force them."
Narumi-san shot a dangerous look at Lawyer Takamine, who was in the corner of the room.
#Takamine
"Hmph..."
#Souko
"It's a waste, they're so delicious."
Souko-san munched on a sandwich, seemingly unbothered.
#Main Character
"...Souko-san, what's in that bag?"
I noticed the bag Souko-san was carrying.
#Souko
"Empty cola bottles. They were piling up in my room, so I thought I'd throw them away."
#Narumi
"I'll take them for you, then. I'll dispose of them in the kitchen."
Narumi-san took the empty bottles.
#Souko
"Thanks, I appreciate it."
#Main Character
"Well then... I'll have some as well."
With a polite word, I took a piece of sandwich.
It had boiled egg inside.
#Benio
"And my sister?"
Benio-san asked Ai-san.
#Ai
"I... don't really have much of an appetite yet."
#Benio
"I see. It's best not to push yourself."
The cocoa Ai-san had made was placed in front of me.
#Main Character
"Ah, thank you."
#Ai
"It's nothing..."
The cocoa Benio-san had made was placed in front of me.
#Main Character
"Ah, thank you."
#Benio
"Don't worry about it."
The door opened, and Tsujimura-san and Shion-san entered.
#Main Character
"Good morning."
#Tsujimura
"Good morning, everyone."
After exchanging greetings with Tsujimura-san, I stole a glance at Shion-san.
#Shion
"............"
She looked unwell.
#Main Character
"Shion-san...?"
#Shion
"Ah, yes... is something wrong...?"
#Main Character
"You don't look very well..."
#Shion
"Yes... I'm feeling a little under the weather..."
#Souko
"Are you all right...?"
#Benio
"Shion, can you manage some breakfast?"
#Shion
"Yes..."
Shion-san gave a small nod and picked up a sandwich.
#Benio
"Tsujimura, why don't you eat something too?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, I think I will."
The door opened, and Dr. Mikanagi entered.
#Mikanagi
"It seems everyone is here."
#Main Character
"Good morning, Dr. Mikanagi."
#Mikanagi
"Good morning. Madam isn't feeling well and is resting in her room, so could someone bring her some food later?"
#Akane
"Y-Yes!"
#Souko
"Is she going to be all right?"
Souko-san asked with concern.
#Mikanagi
"...It might be the strain. A lot happened yesterday alone."
#Benio
"Well... it can't be helped. Mother has never been particularly strong."
#Main Character
"...I hope we can be released soon."
Some people will surely start to find this confinement unbearable before long.
Before we reach our limit, I have to find the culprit somehow and put everyone's mind at ease.
#Souko
"...Don't put too much pressure on yourself."
Souko-san muttered as she sipped her cola.
