I’ve arrived at the dining hall.
＃Akane
"Ah, good morning."
Akane-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Good morning, Akane-san."
＃Akane
"Are you here for breakfast?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes. Is there anything ready?"
＃Akane
"Of course. Please wait just a moment."
With that, Akane-san headed off toward the kitchen.
As I sat and waited, she soon returned with a tray.
＃Akane
"It's just toast and fried eggs, if that's alright?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes, thank you."
I take a large bite of the golden-brown toast.
＃Protagonist
"Hay, Ah-kahn-ay-shahn."
＃Akane
"Please finish what's in your mouth before you try to speak."
Akane-san scolds me with a laugh.
＃Protagonist
"Ngh... um, do you have a moment?"
＃Akane
"Yes? What is it?"
I’ve returned to the dining hall.
＃Akane
"Oh, is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Um..."
I’ve arrived at the dining hall.
＃Benio
"Oh, it's you."
Benio-san was eating breakfast alone.
Akane-san was nearby, attending to her.
＃Benio
"Are you here for breakfast too?"
＃Protagonist
"No, I..."
Right now, there's something I'd rather do than eat.
Should I talk to Benio-san or Akane-san?
