"Ai-san, huh... If she had feelings for Rokuyou-san, it's possible she couldn't forgive the marriage... and that led to this."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Maya
"Ai? It's true she got along well with Isamu-san, but..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Last night, I went to sleep in my room immediately after the wedding..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"My sister? She might not have disliked Rokuyou, but killing him over something like that only happens in stories."
#Satoshi
"Right... I suppose so."
#Shion
"Lady Ai... did she have some kind of relationship with Master Rokuyou...?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know that yet, but..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Ai? It is true she was on good terms with Master Rokuyou... but even so..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Ai-kun is a delicate soul. She couldn't possibly be capable of such a deed."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Mikanagi
"Ai-san, huh... You never know what a girl might do when she's backed into a corner emotionally..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Lady Ai? But I don't think anyone in this mansion could do such a thing..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Lady Ai? She definitely has a dangerous side where you don't know what she'll do if she snaps... but I don't think she'd kill someone."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
