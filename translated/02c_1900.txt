Just as we reached the front of Ai-san's room, the hallway lights flickered on.
#Mikanagi
"It seems Tsujimura-san has repaired the generator."
#Souko
"……I wonder if it's because everyone besides Ai-san has been confirmed safe……"
#Satoshi
"……This way. She was found dead in the bathroom."
I said this as if to cut off Souko-san and the Doctor's conversation, then stepped into Ai-san's room.
#Souko
"……An electric cord has been pulled into the bathroom."
Souko-san found the cord stretching from the wall outlet.
#Satoshi
"……It was submerged in the tub when I found it."
#Souko
"I see……"
Souko-san tapped my shoulder lightly and entered the bathroom.
Dr. Mikanagi offered a silent prayer to Ai-san with a somber face.
#Souko
"This is horrible……"
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
#Mikanagi
"I want to pull her out immediately, but…… investigating here should come first."
#Satoshi
"Yeah……"
I gave a vague nod.
#Souko
"Pull yourself together, we're going to investigate here."
Souko-san slapped my back, and I began to move sluggishly.
