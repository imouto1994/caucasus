I passed through the empty office and went outside.
The snow had weakened.
Though starlight was not yet visible, the clouds seemed to have thinned out considerably.
I climbed the tower stairs and stood before Shion-san's room.
#Main Character
"Shion-san, it's me. Are you awake...?"
The door opened from the inside, and Shion-san peered out.
#Shion
"Um... what is it...?"
#Main Character
"I'd like to talk for a moment..."
#Shion
"...Please come in. It must be cold outside."
I was shown into the room.
#Shion
"Is this talk... about the incident...?"
#Main Character
"Yeah, well..."
#Shion
"I see..."
Shion-san looked down.
#Shion
"...I suppose bad deeds cannot be hidden after all..."
#Main Character
"Shion-san..."
I haven't yet grasped the decisive evidence for Rokuyou-san's murder.
Yet... Shion-san is about to confess.
#Shion
"I... killed Rokuyou-sama."
#Main Character
"...I see. But why...?"
#Shion
"I... cannot answer that."
Shion-san looked down again.
#Shion
"It is all... my fault. Even the things I've hidden until now... I will accept any punishment. But..."
#Main Character
"Can you really not tell me the reason...?"
#Shion
"I am so sorry... it was the only thing I could do..."
#Main Character
"...Ai-san as well...?"
#Shion
"...Yes."
#Main Character
"Why..."
Shion-san did not answer.
#Main Character
"...Let's go."
It seemed there was nothing more I could get out of her.
The rest... I'll leave to the police.
