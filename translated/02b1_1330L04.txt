"...There aren't many people here."
It didn't seem like everyone in the manor had gathered.
#Akane
"The Madam and Dr. Mikanagi are in the infirmary."
#Protagonist
"What about Shion-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama is in her own room."
#Souko
"...I see."
Souko-san looked somewhat dissatisfied.
#Takamine
"It shouldn't matter. Just get started already."
Takamine-san said, making no effort to hide his displeasure.
#Souko
"...It can't be helped. Well then, I'm going to start asking about things that are bothering me."
