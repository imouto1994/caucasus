I heard the sound of a bell from inside the room.
#Main Character
"Eh... Love?"
The black cat had slipped into the room before I knew it.
It was scratching at the door.
#Main Character
"Do you want to go out?"
I wasn't sure, but that seemed to be it.
When I opened the door, the black cat went straight into the clinic.
I see... because Benio-san is still sleeping.
I'll go check on her.
#Main Character
"Excuse me."
When I entered the clinic, Dr. Mikanagi was just about to leave.
#Main Character
"Dr. Mikanagi, how is Benio-san...?"
#Mikanagi
"She's still sleeping. ...Actually, could you keep an eye on her? Maya-san just called for me."
#Main Character
"Sure, I don't mind..."
#Mikanagi
"Then I'll leave it to you."
Dr. Mikanagi left the clinic.
I pulled up a chair beside the bed and sat down.
Benio-san seemed to be sleeping soundly.
The black cat jumped onto my lap.
Then it just sat there, staring intently at Benio-san.
#Main Character
"...You were worried too, weren't you?"
I stroked its head.
As if feeling affectionate, the black cat rubbed its face against my hand.
#Benio
"...It's rare for that one to be so attached to someone."
#Main Character
"Ah... Benio-san."
Benio-san had woken up and was sitting up.
#Main Character
"Are you okay...?"
#Benio
"Yes, no problem. Though I've ended up with a bump."
Benio-san laughed as she rubbed her head.
#Main Character
"Um... when you were hit, did you see the person's face?"
#Benio
"...No, it was just a split second. I didn't see who it was. It felt like I was hit with something hard..."
#Main Character
"Was it an empty bottle?"
#Benio
"...Might have been. I didn't see it, so I can't say for sure..."
#Main Character
"Did you notice anything else?"
#Benio
"I gave you that note, didn't I? That's about it."
#Main Character
"The memo that said 'Performance Room'. When did you get that?"
#Benio
"It looks like it was slipped under my door."
#Benio
"You were patrolling around 2:00, right? It was there when I went back to my room afterward. They probably slid it under the door."
#Main Character
"Didn't you think it was dangerous?"
#Benio
"I did... but I couldn't just leave it, could I?"
#Main Character
"But still..."
#Benio
"My safety is important, but right now, putting an end to this ridiculous situation is more important."
#Main Character
"But there's no point if you put yourself in danger, Benio-san!"
#Benio
"Hmm... you're right. I'll be more careful from now on."
#Main Character
"I'll protect you until Dr. Mikanagi gets back."
#Benio
"...Right, I'm counting on you."
#Benio
"...You seem awfully concerned about me."
Benio-san muttered quietly.
#Main Character
"Well, of course. I don't want any more victims."
#Benio
"Is that all...?"
#Main Character
"Eh...?"
#Benio
"...No, it's nothing."
Benio-san lowered her head.
The black cat jumped onto the bed.
#Benio
"...Love is so kind."
#Main Character
"Benio-san...?"
#Benio
"...I'm fine now. You can go."
#Main Character
"But I can't just leave you."
#Benio
"I told you I'm fine, didn't I? Or what? Are you staying here just because the doctor told you to?"
#Main Character
"That's not it!"
#Benio
"—!?"
I'd raised my voice without thinking.
Benio-san flinched.
#Main Character
"...That's not it. I... I want to protect you, Benio-san."
#Benio
"...Don't say such stupid things."
#Main Character
"I'm not joking. I—"
#Benio
"...That's enough."
Benio-san cut me off.
#Benio
"That's enough. If you say any more... I'll just get weak."
#Main Character
"Benio-san...?"
#Benio
"I don't want to rely on you. I... I'm fine on my own."
The black cat looked up at Benio-san with concern.
#Main Character
"Right now... those of us left should be protecting each other."
#Benio
"But there's a killer among us!?"
#Main Character
"I know. But... at the very least, I believe in you, Benio-san. So... please believe in me too."
#Benio
"...You really are an idiot."
Even as she spoke, Benio-san leaned her head against me.
#Benio
"A massive idiot. But... it's not bad."
#Main Character
"...Do you believe in me?"
#Benio
"Will you let me believe in you...?"
Benio-san looked up, her eyes moist.
#Main Character
"Of course."
#Benio
"...I see."
Benio-san nodded and closed her eyes.
#Benio
"Then... I'll choose to believe."
I grabbed both of Benio-san's shoulders.
Benio-san's body tensed up.
#Main Character
"...Is this okay?"
I leaned in and asked softly.
#Benio
"...I said I believe in you, didn't I?"
With that, Benio-san was the one to close the distance and press her lips against mine.
