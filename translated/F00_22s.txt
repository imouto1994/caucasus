I’ve searched all over, but I can't find anything that looks like a key.
The fire in the hearth has been extinguished.
There should be no problem investigating it.
I clear away the accumulated ash and peer deep into the chimney, but I find nothing out of the ordinary.

"...Doesn't look like it's here."

"So it seems. Let's search elsewhere."
It appears that this is not the place.
There is another door further inside, separate from the one we entered through.
It likely connects to the adjacent room.
It seems to be a door connecting to the next room over.
The world outside the window is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
A painting is on display.
I don't know who the artist is, but it's a beautiful piece.
I've already searched this area, so let's look elsewhere.
There isn't a single stain on the sheets covering the bed.
Likely because nobody has been using it.
There is no sign of the bed having been used.
When I open the drawer, I find something inside that looks like an envelope.
The front of the envelope has 'To Lady Benio' written on it in messy handwriting.
What is this...? It looks like a letter...
Feeling a bit guilty, I pull out the stationery from inside.
"Takoyaki fortune result: Helping people will bring you good things. Your lucky item is a "Carriage." You were a real help to me, kid. See ya."

"...What the hell is this?"
Let's just pretend I never saw that.
I really shouldn't just go opening things without permission...
It's probably best not to meddle with it.
Inside the cupboard, I find a strangely shaped iron plate.
It has eight hemispherical indentations spaced evenly apart.
They're about the size of golf balls.
I don't really understand, but I wonder if it belonged to whoever was using this room.
I'll just leave it be.
It's probably best not to meddle with it.
