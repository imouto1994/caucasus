Souko-san descended the stairs, still holding Maya-san.
＃Protagonist
"Where do you intend to go...?"
＃Souko
"Just over there."
Souko-san used her free hand to open the door to the northern corridor.
＃Benio
"—The chapel."
＃Souko
"Bullseye. ...Would you mind waiting here? It'll be over soon."
＃Takamine
"—That won't happen."
Takamine-san stepped forward.
＃Takamine
"If you are Kanon-kun—I must stop you at all costs."
＃Souko
"I'm grateful to you—Takamine-san. For saving me. ...But you see, I wish you'd saved my mother too while you were at it."
＃Takamine
"That... was impossible. By the time I arrived, it was already—"
＃Souko
"Then don't say a word!"
Souko-san screamed and made a shallow cut on Maya-san's neck.
＃Maya
"Ngh... T-Takamine-san, please step back..."
＃Takamine
"B-But—"
＃Maya
"Step back...!"
With Maya-san telling him again, Takamine-san took several steps back.
＃Souko
"...That's better."
Souko-san whirled around and vanished behind the door.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san—!"
Benio-san grabbed my shoulder as I tried to follow.
＃Benio
"Don't provoke her. You too, Takamine."
＃Takamine
"...I'm sorry."
＃Protagonist
"But... there's nowhere to run. It's a fact that Souko-san is cornered..."
＃Benio
"She said she wanted her to taste despair..."
＃Protagonist
"...If it's the same as with Marino-san—!!"
That’s the only way—!!
I dove into the northern corridor.
＃Benio
"Hey—!!"
＃Protagonist
"No, Souko-san!!"
Behind the door at the very end of the hall.
The moment I opened the door, flames scorched my skin for an instant.
＃Protagonist
"Whoa—!?"
＃Benio
"What—!?"
Benio-san, who was about to dive into the chapel, also stumbled back several steps.
＃Protagonist
"Stop this madness, Souko-san!"
I shouted toward Souko-san, who was near the altar behind the flames.
＃Souko
"...You see, I've lived my whole life for this. ...I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you."
With that.
Souko-san poured the liquid from a large metal can on the floor over her head.
＃Souko
"...I'm sorry."
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san!!"
The fire grew larger.
The flames spread to the fallen Maya-san as well.
Souko-san was as if—clad in garments of fire.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san—"
＃Benio
"Stop!!"
Benio-san grabbed my arm as I took a step toward Souko-san.
＃Benio
"Tsujimura! Takamine! Get the fire extinguishers!!"
＃Tsujimura
"R-Right away—!"
The two of them dashed away.
＃Benio
"Dammit—Mother...!"
Maya-san's body was also engulfed in flames.
＃Mikanagi
"...Let's back off for now. There's nothing we can do against the intensity of these flames."
＃Protagonist
"But still...!"
＃Narumi
"Just come on...!"
Benio-san was pulled back by Dr. Mikanagi, and I by Narumi-san.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san—!!"
