「Narumi-san, huh... There are times when I honestly have no idea what's going on in that head of hers...」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Souko
「It looks like she was injured in that explosion earlier... I wonder if she's alright.」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
＃Maya
「Narumi? Her talent for cooking is truly wonderful. However... I do wish she would take her other duties a bit more seriously...」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Maya
「The explosion in the kitchen... yes... I wonder if she is quite alright...」
＃Protagonist
「I believe she'll be fine, but...」
＃Ai
「Narumi-san... Her cooking is always delicious, but... well, her performance in her other tasks is a bit...」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Ai
「Narumi-san was caught in the explosion... Was she the target, I wonder...」
＃Protagonist
「Who knows...」
＃Benio
「Narumi? Her skills in the kitchen are top-tier, at least. As for everything else... well, you can imagine.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Benio
「...The kitchen explosion might have been an attempt on her life. However... it may be too hasty to conclude that just yet...」
＃Protagonist
「I wonder...」
＃Tsujimura
「As for Mizumori-san... it would be a great help to me as well if she would work diligently at things other than just cooking...」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Tsujimura
「Mizumori-san is currently resting in her room. Her injuries don't seem to be serious, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Takamine
「Mizumori-kun... I don't know her well. The food isn't bad, but...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「There's a possibility Mizumori-kun was targeted... but if so, why?」
＃Protagonist
「We don't know that yet...」
＃Mikanagi
「Narumi-san? Her cooking is delicious. Everything else... I don't know much about.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Mikanagi
「Narumi-san's injuries aren't an issue. It seems she managed to move away just in time.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
