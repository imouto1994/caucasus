The fire couldn't be extinguished in time.
We could only stare blankly as the Nanatsuki mansion burned to the ground.
Black smoke rose into the sky.
If they saw this, people from the foot of the mountain would come.
Then we could go home.
I wanted to go home with Souko-san?
If I listened closely, it felt as if I could still hear Souko-san's song.
But all I could hear was the sound of the raging flames crackling.
Benio-san came close.
＃Benio
「?I'm sorry.」
＃Protagonist
「...It's not your fault, Benio-san. Besides... we're the ones who caused trouble.」
＃Benio
「But... the whole thing started with the Nanatsuki family. The reason she took action must have been because of my mother...」
＃Protagonist
「But... was there no other way...?」
＃Benio
「...I wonder. If her primary goal was revenge for her mother, she likely wouldn't have chosen any other means. That was her choice.」
＃Protagonist
「But still... even Ai-san and Shion-san... this is too sad...」
＃Benio
「You're right...」
We fell silent, watching the mansion continue to burn.
The remains of Souko-san, Maya-san, Shion-san, Ai-san, Akane-san, and Rokuyou-san?
All their bodies were being cremated.
＃Tsujimura
「Benio-ojousama.」
Tsujimura-san arrived.
＃Benio
「What is it?」
＃Tsujimura
「It seems people from below have arrived. Lord Takamine is currently speaking with them by the bridge.」
＃Benio
「I see... when do you think we can go down?」
＃Tsujimura
「I cannot say... after all, there are far too many victims...」
＃Benio
「Even once we're off the mountain, it looks like we'll be in the hands of the police... I suppose it can't be helped.」
＃Protagonist
「Right... we'll have to explain what happened, too.」
＃Tsujimura
「I'm sure Lord Takamine will handle that sort of thing for us...」
＃Protagonist
「Whoa?」
Sparks flew all the way over to us.
＃Benio
「...It might be better to move further away.」
Benio-san said, grabbing my arm.
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
We moved away from the front of the Nanatsuki mansion.
＃Protagonist
「...Benio-san, what are you going to do after this?」
＃Benio
「Well... I've lost both my family and my home. ...Oh, right, it was revealed that the doctor is my brother.」
＃Protagonist
「Then, will you stay with Dr. Mikanagi?」
I stole a glance at Dr. Mikanagi, who was by the bridge.
Narumi-san seemed to be over there as well.
＃Benio
「...I can't do that now. I'm a Nanatsuki, through and through.」
＃Tsujimura
「Um... if it would please Benio-ojousama, I have a house in Tokyo...」
Tsujimura-san tentatively offered.
＃Benio
「Tokyo, huh... that's not bad either, but...」
Benio-san looked at me.
＃Protagonist
「What is it...?」
＃Benio
「...Yeah, hanging out with you might not be bad either.」
＃Protagonist
「Wha... what's that supposed to mean...!?」
＃Tsujimura
「Benio-ojousama...!?」
＃Benio
「Alright, it's decided. I'll be counting on you from now on.」
With that, Benio-san patted my back.
＃Protagonist
「Even if you say that...」
＃Narumi
「?The bridge is almost ready!」
Narumi-san returned at just the right time.
＃Protagonist
「I-I'll go ahead to the bridge then.」
I immediately started walking toward the bridge.
＃Benio
「Ah?hey, don't run away!」
Benio-san chased after me.
＃Narumi
「...What happened?」
＃Tsujimura
「I... have no idea myself...」
＃Benio
「Wait, hey!」
Running along the snowy path with Benio-san.
Suddenly, I stopped and looked behind me.
The Nanatsuki mansion, still burning.
...Goodbye, Souko-san, Shion-san?
I offered a silent prayer in my heart.
＃Benio
「...What's wrong?」
＃Protagonist
「...No, it's nothing. Well then?let's go.」
