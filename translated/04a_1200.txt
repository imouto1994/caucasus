On the morning of the fourth day since our arrival, the driver from the foot of the mountain found the destroyed suspension bridge as planned.
Benio-san, who had gone to check on the situation on the opposite bank, negotiated with him, and the driver returned to bring back a police officer and several laborers by early afternoon.
They hurriedly constructed a scaffold, and by the time they had managed to span a bridge wide enough for one person and the officer crossed over, it was already evening.
#Police Officer
"——So, we are to conclude that Isamu Rokuyou passed away from a <sudden><illness>, correct?"
#Maya
"Yes. Due to the fear of infection, we have already cremated the remains here."
#Police Officer
"Understood. I will convey that to the Chief as well."
#Main Character
"...Is this really okay?"
#Mikanagi
"Of course it isn't. But you see, sometimes things like this are necessary."
I couldn't accept it, but I suppose I had to.
Because I had failed.
I looked over at Souko-san, who was standing a short distance away.
Because I couldn't bring myself to accuse her.
Because of that, everything was being swept under the rug.
Rokuyou-san's death was an illness; Ai-san was away for medical recuperation.
As for Shion-san, she was now completely imprisoned within the tower.
Benio-san approached me.
#Benio
"Are you leaving too?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... that's the plan, but..."
#Benio
"……With her?"
Benio-san looked toward Souko-san.
#Main Character
"……Yes."
My suspicion toward Souko-san.
It wasn't suspicion anymore; it was a cold certainty.
Could I jump out in front of that officer right now and scream the truth?
No——it was impossible.
No one would listen to what I had to say.
I had lost my one and only chance.
#Souko
"Well then, shall we head home?"
Souko-san said it with such brazen nonchalance.
As if——truly nothing had ever happened.
#Main Character
"……I suppose so."
I picked up only my own luggage.
#Souko
"Oh? You're not going to carry mine?"
#Main Character
"……That finger of yours isn't even broken, is it?"
#Souko
"Well, you're right about that."
Souko-san casually unraveled the bandage wrapped around her finger.
#Souko
"But still, I don't think it's very nice to be so cold to a girl, you know?"
#Main Character
"I haven't——I haven't forgiven you."
I started walking, following after Souko-san as she took the lead.
#Souko
"I think your reasoning was good. You just lacked the final touch. If you hadn't rushed and thought it through a bit more, you might have cornered me. But——"
Souko-san twirled around to face me.
#Souko
"You're ten years too early to think you could beat me."
I knew it——I stood no chance against Souko-san.
