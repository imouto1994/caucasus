I left the dining room and headed to the north hallway on the first floor.
＃Protagonist
「Takamine-san, it's me.」
The door opened.
＃Takamine
「Do you need something?」
A blunt Takamine-san appeared, though he didn't seem particularly displeased.
＃Protagonist
「I brought food. And... can we talk for a bit?」
There are a few things I want to confirm.
＃Takamine
「...I don't mind.」
Takamine-san opened the door wide.
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
Takamine-san's room was neatly organized.
A photo frame was placed on top of the shelf.
I wonder if that's the photo Narumi-san was talking about.
＃Takamine
「Well, have a seat.」
Takamine-san offered me a chair, so I sat down quietly.
I can't see the photo from here.
＃Takamine
「I believe I said I didn't need any food.」
＃Protagonist
「But you won't last long if you don't eat, you know? A poison test has been done, so there's no problem.」
＃Takamine
「...Hmph.」
Takamine-san reluctantly accepted the plate of fried rice.
He placed the plate on the shelf and knocked over the photo frame.
＃Takamine
「?So, what did you want to talk about?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, um... I wanted to ask about Mr. Kousei's will...」
Takamine-san's gaze sharpened.
＃Takamine
「...Do you think I can tell that to an outsider?」
＃Protagonist
「Y-You're right, of course...」
I guess it's impossible after all...
＃Takamine
「...However, given the situation.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
＃Takamine
「You're looking for the culprit, aren't you? It might provide some sort of clue.」
It seems Takamine-san is willing to cooperate.
＃Protagonist
「T-Thank you very much.」
＃Takamine
「Mind you, it's only what I remember. Mainly the method of distributing the inheritance.」
＃Protagonist
「That's more than enough. ...I heard that even if Rokuyou-san married Shion-san, there would be no benefit.」
＃Takamine
「Ah... that matter.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that because Shion-san is adopted?」
＃Takamine
「I don't know what his personal motives were. However, the will stated that the inheritance was to be divided equally among Nanatsuki Maya, Nanatsuki Ai, and Nanatsuki Benio, one-third each.」
＃Protagonist
「If that's the case... then Shion-san really wouldn't receive a single cent.」
＃Takamine
「If she had married Rokuyou-kun, she would have gained access to the Rokuyou family's assets. But even that is no longer possible.」
＃Protagonist
「Was this marriage proposed by Rokuyou-san?」
＃Takamine
「That's what I heard. I don't know what his intentions were, but Maya-san was said to be delighted.」
＃Protagonist
「Was it just getting rid of a nuisance after all...?」
＃Takamine
「...Perhaps.」
Takamine-san let out a long breath.
＃Takamine
「That's about all I can tell you.」
＃Protagonist
「Thank you very much.」
I wanted to ask more, but this seemed like the right time to stop.
＃Protagonist
「Well then, excuse me.」
