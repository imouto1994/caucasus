Right across from the infirmary was my own room.
#Souko
"You're late."
Souko-san was already in my room.
#Protagonist
"Why are you here already...?"
#Souko
"You didn't lock the door."
Ignoring my question, Souko-san pointed that out.
#Souko
"You never know what might happen, so make sure you keep the door locked tight."
#Protagonist
"...Do you really think something else is going to happen, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"It would be best if nothing did, but..."
#Protagonist
"So you're saying there's a chance?"
#Souko
"It’s better to consider it a possibility."
#Protagonist
"I suppose so..."
#Souko
"Now then—let’s think about the incident from earlier."
Souko-san straightened her posture and turned to face me.
#Souko
"I hope there’s a clue among the things you found..."
#Protagonist
"I think it’s better to think it over than to just worry. However..."
#Souko
"However?"
#Protagonist
"...Is it really okay for us outsiders to just start exposing the killer on our own?"
#Souko
"...I think we're the only ones who can do it, but... it’s a difficult position. If we handle it poorly, it could interfere with our actions from here on."
#Protagonist
"It’ll be quite a while before we can leave this place..."
We might end up spending several days in a thick, stifling atmosphere.
#Souko
"So, whether or not to point out the killer is up to you. If you're confident in your reasoning, I don't think it'll be a problem."
#Protagonist
"That's a lot of responsibility..."
Now then... what should I do?
[Point out the killer]
[Don't point out the killer]
#Protagonist
"...If it’s something we can do, I think we have to do it."
#Souko
"I see... In that case, I’ll gather everyone and have you explain it to them, alright?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah... let’s go."
#Protagonist
"...Let’s not."
I lacked the confidence. Not confidence in finding the killer—but confidence in being able to settle things properly afterward.
#Souko
"...True, that might be for the best."
Souko-san seemed to agree.
#Protagonist
"Let’s just watch how things play out for a while."
#Souko
"Understood."
We decided to take a little time to organize our thoughts separately.
