#Main Character
"Shion-san..."
I approached Shion-san's remains.
This was clearly different from the previous cases.
#Main Character
"Is it poison...?"
#Souko
"It would seem so. Unlike the others, there's a possibility of suicide here."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Main Character
"Can you tell what kind of poison killed her...?"
#Souko
"Wait a second..."
Souko-san leaned her face close to Shion-san's mouth.
#Souko
"This smell... maybe cyanide."
#Main Character
"You can tell?"
#Souko
"No... I've never smelled the real thing, but I detect a bittersweet scent. But if that's the case, another problem arises..."
#Main Character
"...If I recall, potassium cyanide has such a terrible taste that it would be impossible to make someone drink it without them noticing."
#Souko
"Exactly. But that only strengthens the possibility that it was Shion-san's suicide."
#Main Character
"...She might have been forced to drink it."
#Souko
"...That's possible too."
#Main Character
"...It doesn't look like we can reach a conclusion right now."
#Souko
"Right. Let's question everyone else later."
#Main Character
"But... wasn't it aconite that was used when Shion-san collapsed this morning? Why use something different now...?"
#Souko
"...Maybe because a different person set it up?"
#Main Character
"What—!?"
#Souko
"Or, perhaps they intentionally used a different poison to cause confusion... though now that Dr. Mikanagi has been killed, there's not much point in that."
#Main Character
"Then... assuming it was a different person, which is which...?"
#Souko
"There are two possibilities. First, if this was Shion-san's suicide, then this morning's incident was a genuine attempted poisoning by a third party."
#Souko
"And if this was murder... then this morning's incident was Shion-san's own staged performance. Personally, I think the latter is more likely."
#Main Character
"Why...?"
#Souko
"...Because she didn't actually intend to die. It didn't seem to be a lethal dose, after all..."
#Main Character
"In that case... the one who used the cyanide was..."
#Souko
"...Yeah."
Souko-san nodded with a sigh.
Shion-san... why...
Paintings are hanging on the wall.
...They're Tsujimura-san's paintings.
The artwork Tsujimura-san painted looked down upon Shion-san's silent remains.
#Main Character
"...It's probably best not to touch this carelessly."
There are likely fingerprints on it.
#Souko
"I don't think it matters much... the contents of the cup are more important. We have to identify exactly what kind of poison it was."
#Main Character
"What did she drink...?"
#Souko
"A fast-acting poison, surely... but if it was something highly irritant, it would be difficult."
#Main Character
"Because she would have spat it out..."
#Souko
"It's not just that. The possibility of murder also drops significantly. No one would drink something they knew was poison."
#Main Character
"True... but the one who brought this medicine was Maya-san, wasn't it...?"
#Souko
"...Of course, there's a possibility that Maya-san killed Shion-san. That's exactly why we have to investigate carefully."
Souko-san picked up the cup using a handkerchief to avoid touching it directly.
#Souko
"A little bit of liquid remains. If the police analyze it, they'll be able to determine the ingredients."
#Main Character
"But then—"
#Souko
"I know. There must be more we can do right here."
How could this happen...
The snow seems to be weakening.
It'll likely be clear tomorrow, but this mansion...
The snow is letting up.
