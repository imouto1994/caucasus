This is definitely Rokuyou-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Rokuyou
"Oh, it's you. Do you need something?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, I wanted to ask you a few things."
#Rokuyou
"I see. It's not the best place to talk out here, so please, come in."
With that, Rokuyou-san led me into the room.
#Rokuyou
"I have preparations for the ceremony, so is it all right if we finish by then?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, thank you very much."
Now then, what should I do...
This is Rokuyou-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
#Rokuyou
"Oh, it's you again. Do you need something?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, I wanted to ask you a few things again."
#Rokuyou
"I see. Please, come in."
With that, Rokuyou-san led me into the room.
#Rokuyou
"I don't have much time, is that all right?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, thank you very much."
Now then, what should I do...
I've come to Rokuyou-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
I wait for a while, but there was no response from inside.
Is he not in?
He might be preparing for the wedding.
I gave up and decided to go somewhere else.
