I stood in front of my room, staring down toward the end of the hallway.
It was the room of the former head of the house, Mr. Kousei.
Despite all the information I had gathered—things that seemed unrelated to the incident—I still couldn't grasp the full picture.
The hidden darkness of the Nanatsuki family—the "Curse of the Nanatsuki."
There were deep-seated connections between the people gathered here.
I desperately wanted to know the truth.
Because that—that might be the key to solving the case.
First—I wanted to investigate this "forbidden room."
I hadn't seen the inside of it once since I arrived.
I decided to ask Tsujimura-san.
＃Protagonist
"Excuse me. Tsujimura-san—"
I spoke up as I entered the office.
＃Tsujimura
"Is something the matter?"
＃Protagonist
"Um... I have a favor to ask."
＃Tsujimura
"What would that be?"
＃Protagonist
"I want to see the inside of Kousei-san's room at the back of the second floor."
＃Tsujimura
"That... is not something I can decide on my own..."
Tsujimura-san hung his head.
＃Protagonist
"Is it not allowed...?"
＃Tsujimura
"...That room has been closed ever since the Master passed away. The Madam decided it should be so..."
＃Protagonist
"Is there no way you could open it for me in secret...?"
＃Tsujimura
"...I am truly sorry."
Tsujimura-san bowed deeply.
I couldn't tell if there was a specific reason it couldn't be opened, or if he was simply trying to fulfill his duty as the manager—
＃Protagonist
"...No, I should be the one apologizing for asking such an unreasonable thing..."
＃Tsujimura
"No, please do not trouble yourself over it..."
When Tsujimura-san looked up, he seemed to have a faint expression of relief on his face.
