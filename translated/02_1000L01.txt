When we returned to the Great Hall, more people had gathered.
Shion-san was sitting next to Ai-san.
＃Mikanagi
「Shion-san, are you alright?」
＃Shion
「Yes... um, Rokuyou-sama is...」
All the color had completely drained from her already pale face.
＃Ai
「Shion...」
Ai-san pulled Shion-san’s body close.
＃Souko
「Everyone’s here, then.」
＃Benio
「Did you find out anything?」
Benio-san asked.
＃Protagonist
「Well, I think we’ve figured out at least a few things.」
＃Souko
「Now then, we’re going to ask you a few things that have been on our minds.」
