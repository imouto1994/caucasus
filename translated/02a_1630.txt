I woke up to the sound of someone knocking on the door.
I checked the clock.
It seems I had been asleep for about thirty minutes.
I wonder who it is...
＃Protagonist
「I'll open it now.」
I approached the door, unlocked it, and peeked out into the hallway through a narrow opening.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... Ai-san.」
Ai-san was in the hallway.
＃Ai
「Um... do you have a moment?」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes... please come in.」
I immediately opened the door wide and invited Ai-san inside.
＃Protagonist
「Are you feeling alright now...?」
＃Ai
「Yes... my throat still hurts a little, but there's no need to worry. I was just on my way back to my room, but I wanted to say a word of thanks...」
＃Protagonist
「No... I didn't really do anything special...」
＃Ai
「That's not true. You saved my life.」
Ai-san bowed deeply.
＃Protagonist
「Um... by the way, this might be very difficult to ask, but do you remember anything from when you were attacked?」
＃Ai
「That...」
Ai-san looked down.
＃Protagonist
「...I won't force you. But if you do, I think we can prevent something like this from happening again.」
＃Ai
「Yes... you're right.」
Ai-san nodded.
＃Ai
「But... I don't remember much either.」
＃Protagonist
「You don't remember...?」
＃Ai
「After I went up to the clock room in the attic... I was hit from behind and lost consciousness...」
＃Protagonist
「You don't know who it was?」
＃Ai
「I... I didn't know.」
Ai-san shook her head.
＃Protagonist
「Then... why did you go to the attic?」
＃Ai
「There was... a note in my room. It said to come to the attic at 11:40.」
＃Protagonist
「Did you recognize the handwriting?」
＃Ai
「...No, I didn't.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
If that's the case, it makes Ai-san's reason for going to the attic even more mysterious.
With Rokuyou-san killed and the culprit still at large, would someone really respond to a summons written in unfamiliar handwriting?
Furthermore, she had thrown that note into the fireplace and burned it.
＃Protagonist
「...Ai-san, could you tell if the handwriting on that note belonged to a man or a woman?」
＃Ai
「I... I couldn't tell that either.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... Sorry for questioning you like this.」
＃Ai
「No... I'm the one who should be sorry for not remembering anything...」
We both bowed to each other.
I should leave it at that for now.
Ai-san has only just recovered, after all.
＃Ai
「Um, and so... I'd like to thank you...」
Ai-san timidly made the offer.
＃Protagonist
「A thank you... No, really, that's not necessary.」
＃Ai
「But... I want to...」
Saying so, Ai-san clung to me.
＃Protagonist
「Eh...!? A-Ai-san...!?」
My slender frame couldn't support her weight, and we tumbled onto the bed.
Her voluptuous body was pressed against mine.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
I gently placed my hands on Ai-san's shoulders.
Embrace her
Don't embrace her
＃Protagonist
「...You're still not feeling well, right? You shouldn't overexert yourself.」
I pulled away from Ai-san's body.
＃Ai
「But... I'm fine...」
＃Protagonist
「I'm a man too, so I'm happy you'd offer. But... I think doing something like that as a 'thank you' is a bit different.」
I stood up from the bed.
＃Ai
「Are you... actually dating Kirihara-san...?」
＃Protagonist
「That's not it. Souko-san isn't really a romantic interest; she's more like someone I admire.」
＃Protagonist
「She has her sloppy moments, but she's sharp... and, how do I say it, she's cool.」
＃Ai
「...Is that so.」
Ai-san let out a sigh.
＃Ai
「There was a time... when I felt that way too. But... those kinds of feelings never come true, do they...?」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san... are you talking about Rokuyou-san...?」
She neither denied nor confirmed it.
She simply lowered her eyes sorrowfully.
＃Ai
「...I was blessing the future of those two... but I... loved him much more...」
Ai-san began to sob.
I couldn't say anything; I could only gently support her shoulders.
＃Protagonist
「I'm... a man too. You can't expect me to hold back when you're pressing me like this...」
＃Ai
「You don't have to... hold back, you know...?」
Ai-san's lips drew closer.
