「The possibility of Maya-san being the killer... I doubt it. ...Unless there was a will stating that the entire estate would be inherited by Ai-san, that is.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Maya
「I remained in my room the entire time. It was a blackout... I decided it was best not to move. Mikanagi-sensei did come to check on me.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Mother would have no reason to kill my sister, would she? The inheritance doesn't concern her anyway.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Shion
「I believe Mother... would have been in her room.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「The Mistress? She should have been in her room the entire time...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「I wouldn't know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「...Maya-san was in her room. I went to check on her during the blackout, so there's no mistake.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「The Mistress has been resting in her room this whole time... the mental strain seems ceaseless.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「If it's the Mistress, I think she was in her room the whole time... but the possibility of her killing Lady Ai... well, I can't say it's zero, considering the distribution of the inheritance and all.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
