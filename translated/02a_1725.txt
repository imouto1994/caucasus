The room was getting dark, so I switched on the light.
#Protagonist
"By the way, Ai-san, is your head alright after being hit?"
#Ai
"Yes, a bump formed, but please don't worry about it."
Ai-san smiled while lightly rubbing her head.
#Protagonist
"But I wonder why things turned out like this..."
#Ai
"Yes... you're right... I can only think that the wedding triggered something—"
Suddenly, the lights flickered and died.
#Ai
"Kyaa!?"
Ai-san let out a scream.
#Protagonist
"Is it a blackout...?"
My eyes, somewhat used to the dimness, scanned the room.
The light reflected off the snow outside was filtering through the window.
Between that and the glow from the fireplace, it wasn't pitch black.
I moved to the wall and flicked the light switch, but it didn't make a sound.
#Protagonist
"Ai-san—"
#Ai
"Nooo!!"
My voice was drowned out by Ai-san's shriek.
#Ai
"Hiee, no, stop, no..."
Ai-san was sobbing.
#Protagonist
"It's okay, Ai-san... I'm right here."
As I repeatedly offered her words of encouragement, her sobbing began to quiet down.
She seemed terribly frightened.
#Ai
"Wh... what happened...?"
#Protagonist
"I think it's just a simple power outage."
I said that just to put her at ease.
Deep down, I couldn't bring myself to believe it was that simple.
There was a high probability that the culprit was acting with some kind of intent.
I wanted to go and investigate, but—
I looked at Ai-san.
Even in the dim light, I could tell her face had gone pale.
What should I do... It might be a problem to leave her all alone in this room like this.
Take her to her own room.
Leave her in this room.
#Protagonist
"...Ai-san."
#Ai
"Y... yes...?"
#Protagonist
"I'm going to go investigate the cause of this blackout. But before that... I'll walk you back to your room."
#Ai
"Y-Yes..."
Ai-san nodded, still trembling.
I took Ai-san with me and stepped out into the hallway.
She was gripping the sleeve of my clothes tightly.
Nobody else had come out into the hallway yet.
I wondered if Dr. Mikanagi was in his room or the infirmary.
#Protagonist
"...Let's go."
I moved through the manor with Ai-san.
We arrived in front of Ai-san's room.
#Protagonist
"Ai-san, please go inside your room, lock the door, and stay put."
#Ai
"Yes... um, please be careful."
#Protagonist
"Yeah, I know."
Ai-san bowed and went inside her room.
I heard the door lock.
...Good.
#Protagonist
"...Ai-san."
#Ai
"Y... yes...?"
#Protagonist
"I'm going to go investigate the cause of this blackout. So, I need you to stay in this room."
#Ai
"Eh... b-but..."
Ai-san's voice sounded lonely and anxious.
#Protagonist
"Being in this room is probably the safest thing for you. No matter who comes, if it's not me, don't ever open the door, okay?"
#Ai
"I... I understand."
Ai-san nodded.
#Protagonist
"Alright, I'm heading out. Make sure you lock the door."
#Ai
"Yes... um, please be careful."
#Protagonist
"Yeah, I know."
I bowed to Ai-san and stepped out of the room.
Click—I heard the lock turn.
...Good.
