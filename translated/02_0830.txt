As we stepped into the hallway, Akane-san came rushing toward us, her face pale and drawn.
#Akane
"Tsujimura-san...!"
#Tsujimura
"Take Shion-ojousama to that room over there."
#Akane
"Y-yes, sir."
Akane-san led Shion-san toward the spare room.
#Souko
"What do you plan to do now?"
#Tsujimura
"...We have to contact the police."
#Protagonist
"Ah, but the phones don't seem to be working... I checked earlier, it looks like the line is dead somewhere..."
#Tsujimura
"Dead... In that case, someone will have to walk down to the station at the foot of the mountain..."
#Souko
"...Let’s check the phone one more time."
Souko-san took the lead and began walking.
#Ai
"Let go of me! Let me go!!"
As soon as we entered the west corridor, we heard Ai-san screaming.
#Narumi
"Ojousama! Please, calm down!"
The tall Narumi-san was holding Ai-san back.
#Ai
"But! Isamu-san is... Isamu-san is...!!"
#Tsujimura
"Ai-ojousama...!"
Tsujimura-san hurried over to help restrain Ai-san.
#Ai
"No, no! Let me go!!"
Ai-san was struggling and sobbing hysterically.
#Benio
"Elder Sister!"
Benio-san burst out of the Great Hall and grabbed Ai-san by the shoulders.
#Ai
"Let me go, Benio! Nooo!"
#Benio
"Sister! Shion is safe, so please, pull yourself together!"
#Ai
"Eh—"
Ai-san stopped struggling instantly.
#Ai
"Shion...?"
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama is resting in another room now."
#Ai
"Ah—"
Ai-san slumped down onto the floor.
#Ai
"Shion is safe...?"
#Benio
"Of course she is. She has nothing to do with this."
#Ai
"I see..."
Ai-san suddenly became quiet.
#Narumi
"Ojousama, this way..."
Narumi-san took Ai-san by the hand and led her back into the Great Hall.
#Benio
"...Tsujimura, have you told Shion?"
#Tsujimura
"...No, not yet."
Tsujimura-san looked down.
#Benio
"I see... It’s probably better that way."
#Tsujimura
"What... what should I tell the others...?"
#Benio
"I told them the truth. He was... murdered, wasn't he?"
#Souko
"Most likely. His head was missing, after all."
#Protagonist
"Who could have done such a thing...?"
#Benio
"Who knows. The killer is likely somewhere in this mansion, but I’d rather not start suspecting my own family."
With that, Benio-san stared directly into my eyes.
#Benio
"Is it not possible that this happened because two outsiders arrived...?"
#Protagonist
"What...?"
Wait—is she suspecting us?
#Souko
"An interesting theory. But from our perspective as outsiders, it seems more likely the cause lies within some family drama."
#Benio
"To be honest, I’m inclined to agree."
Benio-san immediately retracted her previous statement.
#Benio
"We might find something if we examine the body."
#Tsujimura
"Benio-ojousama, first we must call the police..."
#Benio
"I know. But the phones are dead, aren't they?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes..."
#Benio
"I have Takamine-bengoshi checking them now, but... it’s likely futile."
#Tsujimura
"If only we knew where the line was broken..."
#Souko
"...I get the feeling this was intentional."
Souko-san muttered under her breath.
#Benio
"You think someone cut the communications with malicious intent?"
#Souko
"Yeah... When it wouldn't connect earlier, I thought it was just the snow, but now..."
The door to the telephone room opened, and Takamine-san appeared.
#Takamine
"It’s no use. The break isn't on this end."
#Tsujimura
"I see..."
#Protagonist
"...It looks like someone’s going to have to head down to the base of the mountain after all."
#Souko
"Right. Good luck."
Souko-san placed her hand on my shoulder.
#Protagonist
"...Eh?"
#Souko
"It’s still a blizzard out there, so you’d better borrow some proper winter gear."
#Protagonist
"I’m the one going?"
#Souko
"Well, you’re the one who brought it up. Besides—"
Souko-san leaned in and whispered into my ear.
#Souko
"If the killer goes out alone, they’re obviously going to just run away."
#Protagonist
"Ah—"
#Souko
"It’s just a possibility."
Souko-san said as she pulled away from me.
#Benio
"There's no need for conspicuous whispering, you know. I could hear you."
Benio-san furrowed her brow.
#Takamine
"...If you have a guilty conscience yourself, you might be the one to just run off."
#Souko
"Then why don't you send someone from your side along with him? He doesn't even know where the station is, anyway."
#Takamine
"That’s reasonable. I’ll go."
It felt like things were progressing entirely without my input.
#Takamine
"I’ll go get my coat; wait for me at the entrance. And until I return, make sure no one enters Rokuyou-kun’s room."
#Tsujimura
"Yes, I understand."
Tsujimura-san and Takamine-san left together.
#Souko
"Go get your coat."
#Protagonist
"Right."
I nodded and headed back to my room for a moment.
