I returned to my room.
Why... why did one troublesome thing have to happen after another?
What did the fact that Shion-san was targeted even mean?
And the day has only just begun...
#Protagonist
"Whew..."
I collapsed onto the bed.
I must have been exhausted; even though I'd just woken up, a sudden wave of drowsiness washed over me.
Heads were flying.
There were heads everywhere around me.
Rokuyou-san’s head.
Ai-san’s head.
Shion-san’s head.
Benio-san’s head.
Maya-san’s head.
Akane-san’s head and Narumi-san’s head.
Tsujimura-san’s, Dr. Mikanagi’s, and even Takamine-san’s head was there.
Souko-san’s head was right there, too.
Everyone was laughing.
...And yet.
Only my head, right next to Souko-san’s, was crying.
Startled, I tried to touch my own head.
But my hands only cut through the air.
Everyone laughed when they saw that.
I was the only one crying.
What should I do?
First, I have to put my head back.
I picked up my head, which wouldn't stop crying.
It was incredibly light.
It was a hollow, empty head, as if to represent my own humanity.
Still, it was mine.
I tried to set it on top of my body.
But it immediately rolled off and fell.
Everyone laughed when they saw that.
I was the only one crying.
What should I do—
#???
"—Are you okay?"
A voice spoke.
#Protagonist
"Eh... Narumi-san...?"
Narumi-san’s head was looking at me.
She wasn't laughing.
#Protagonist
"Narumi-san... I..."
#Narumi
"Hmm, what is it?"
Narumi-san smiled.
#Protagonist
"...Huh?"
Narumi-san’s head was attached.
I hurriedly checked my own head as well.
Of course, it was attached.
#Protagonist
"Was it a dream...?"
#Narumi
"I'm surprised you can sleep at a time like this..."
Narumi-san muttered, sounding exasperated.
#Protagonist
"Was I... asleep?"
#Narumi
"You certainly were, sound asleep. It was cute, your troubled sleeping face."
#Protagonist
"Please don't... I mean, when did you even come into the room?"
#Narumi
"The door was unlocked."
#Protagonist
"Eh... was it?"
I must have been dazed and forgotten to lock it.
#Protagonist
"...So, what are you here for?"
#Narumi
"It's about Akane. I just remembered something that might be a clue."
#Protagonist
"A clue...?"
#Narumi
"It seems she'd been worrying about something for a little while now. ...Ever since Rokuyou-san started staying here."
#Protagonist
"Rokuyou-san...?"
#Narumi
"Yes... maybe there's some connection... but Akane didn't seem particularly upset yesterday..."
#Protagonist
"...Are you saying something happened with Rokuyou-san?"
#Narumi
"...Something might have, though I don't have any proof."
Narumi-san shook her head.
#Narumi
"I want to help her as much as I can as a colleague... that girl has a habit of forcing herself to act cheerful, after all."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Narumi
"It's certain Akane was up to something, so it might be worth looking into that."
#Protagonist
"Understood."
#Protagonist
"...I actually heard a bit from Akane-san earlier."
#Narumi
"Oh... is that so?"
#Protagonist
"But... hearing about Rokuyou-san now makes me think it might be something else entirely."
Akari Misono-san is deeply connected to Dr. Mikanagi.
The one connected to Rokuyou-san was Akane-san...
And then Rokuyou-san and Dr. Mikanagi were friends...
It's so complicated...
#Narumi
"Well, I'll be going now."
Narumi-san left the room.
This is no time for me to be taking it easy, either.
I need to start moving.
#Narumi
"By the way..."
Narumi-san suddenly approached me, edging closer.
#Protagonist
"W... what is it?"
#Narumi
"Are you dating Kirihara-san?"
#Protagonist
"Why on earth are we talking about that...?"
#Narumi
"Oh, so you aren't?"
#Protagonist
"Souko-san is just my senior. I only came here because she practically forced me to."
#Narumi
"Hmm..."
#Protagonist
"W... what?"
Narumi-san’s smile was scary.
#Narumi
"I was just thinking, if you aren't dating anyone, maybe I could just have you for myself."
#Protagonist
"...Huh?"
...I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
#Narumi
"You're young, aren't you? Surely you've got plenty of pent-up energy?"
Narumi-san leaned over me.
Because of the height difference, I was pushed back onto the bed.
#Protagonist
"Uh... um, shouldn't we calm down...?"
#Narumi
"Don't you think calming down on the bed sounds nice?"
#Protagonist
"Even if you say that... it's still morning, you know?"
#Narumi
"Given the state of things... that doesn't matter."
Narumi-san’s hands grabbed my waist.
I don't know how she did it, but my pants were easily pulled down.
#Narumi
"Now then... prepare yourself."
