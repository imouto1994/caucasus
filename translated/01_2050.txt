"Phew..."
We were even served dessert after the meal.
I'd never had such a lavish meal in my life.
And as a representative of the common folk, I was especially happy that I didn't have to worry about the bill.
I knew I'd never get to eat anything like this in a first-class restaurant ever again.
＃Souko
"Gulp, gulp, gulp... Aaah."
Souko-san was happily drinking the cola she'd brought from her room.
I wish she'd at least poured it into a glass.
I just hoped she wouldn't let out a burp.
As we stepped out of the dining hall, Benio-san was waiting for us in the corridor.
＃Protagonist
"Thank you for the wonderful meal."
＃Benio
"It was my pleasure. I'm glad it was to your liking."
＃Souko
"The wedding ceremony starts at midnight, right?"
＃Benio
"Yes. We'll be starting preparations after ten, so please feel free to spend the time as you wish inside the house until then."
＃Protagonist
"So it's probably best if we stay in our rooms for a while after ten, then."
＃Benio
"Yes. Thank you for your cooperation."
＃Souko
"Oh, that reminds me. There was something I wanted to ask you."
＃Benio
"And what might that be?"
She tilted her head with a smile.
＃Souko
"It's about the 'Curse of the Seven.'"
＃Benio
"Oh? You wish to hear about it?"
＃Souko
"Well, yeah. That's why we came here to investigate, after all."
Benio-san offered a faint, amused smile.
＃Benio
"The 'Curse of the Seven' is, of course, a play on the name Nanatsuki, and as the name implies, there are seven parts to it."
＃Benio
"Though perhaps it would be more accurate to call them the Seven Mysteries rather than a curse."
＃Souko
"And what are they?"
＃Benio
"First, there is—"
Benio-san suddenly cut her words short.
＃Akane
"Benio-ojousama, have you seen Aiko?"
Akane-san poked her head out from the kitchen.
＃Benio
"Love? She's in my room."
＃Akane
"I've got her dinner ready, what should I do?"
＃Benio
"I'll take it to her. ...Now then, Kirihara-san, we shall continue our talk later."
＃Souko
"Alright."
With a small bow, Benio-san took the cat food and walked away.
＃Souko
"You go find her later and ask about it."
＃Protagonist
"Eh, me?"
She could just go herself.
＃Souko
"Doing the legwork is your job. I'll be in my room, so come and let me know if you find anything out."
＃Protagonist
"Alright, alright."
Well, it was always like this.
