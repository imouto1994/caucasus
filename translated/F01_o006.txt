"To think there's even a chapel inside the building... the wealthy really are something else."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Maya
"I believe the chapel has been here since this building was first constructed."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"I've heard that chapel has always been used for the Nanatsuki family's weddings."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"You will be able to see the inside of the chapel later."
#Satoshi
"True."
#Tsujimura
"Preparations for the ceremony are underway now, so you cannot see the inside."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Rokuyou
"No need to rush; you'll be able to go inside later."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
#Takamine
"They're preparing for the ceremony, so you can't go in."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Aren't they preparing for the wedding in the chapel right now?"
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"The chapel is quite a chore to clean. We don't use it normally, so it doesn't get very dirty, though."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"A chapel that's only used for weddings... it's a bit of a luxury, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"I suppose so..."
