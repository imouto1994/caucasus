＃Souko
"To think there's even a chapel inside the building... the wealthy really are something else."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
＃Maya
"I believe the chapel has been here since this building was first constructed."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Ai
"I've heard that chapel has always been used for the Nanatsuki family's weddings."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so..."
＃Benio
"You will be able to see the inside of the chapel later."
＃Protagonist
"True."
＃Tsujimura
"Preparations for the ceremony are underway now, so you cannot see the inside."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Rokuyou
"No need to rush; you'll be able to go inside later."
＃Protagonist
"You're right."
＃Takamine
"They're preparing for the ceremony, so you can't go in."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"Aren't they preparing for the wedding in the chapel right now?"
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Akane
"The chapel is quite a chore to clean. We don't use it normally, so it doesn't get very dirty, though."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Narumi
"A chapel that's only used for weddings... it's a bit of a luxury, isn't it?"
＃Protagonist
"I suppose so..."
