"I wonder why Rokuyou-san had to be killed... I just can't help but be curious about that."
＃Protagonist
"Right."
＃Maya
"...Why was someone like Isamu-san killed...?"
＃Protagonist
"Right."
＃Benio
"...I question whether Rokuyou really loved Shion. I never saw them acting harmoniously."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so?"
＃Shion
"What on earth happened...?"
＃Protagonist
"...I'm in the middle of investigating that right now."
＃Tsujimura
"Master Rokuyou's remains are being kept in his room. We can't simply bury him without permission..."
＃Protagonist
"Right."
＃Takamine
"It seems Rokuyou-kun was killed during the night... but there weren't any sounds of a struggle. It might be because the rooms are well soundproofed..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"To think this would happen to Isamu..."
＃Protagonist
"Right."
＃Narumi
"...I thought it was strange when he didn't show himself this morning, but I never imagined he'd been killed..."
＃Protagonist
"Right."
