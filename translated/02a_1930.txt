When I stepped out of the office, the fierce blizzard was as intense as ever.
A faint trail of small footprints continued toward the tower.
Those are likely Shion-san's footprints.
I stepped into the tower.
Shion-san is on the second floor.
I went up the stairs and knocked on the door.
#Shion
"Yes...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
After I spoke, the door opened from the inside a moment later.
#Shion
"Um... is something the matter...?"
Shion-san's eyes were moist.
I wonder if she’d been crying...
#Satoshi
"I came to make sure that everyone is alright."
#Shion
"...I see."
Shion-san looked down.
#Satoshi
"Umm... so—"
#Shion
"Please, come in..."
Shion-san opened the door and invited me inside.
#Satoshi
"Ah... excuse me."
#Shion
"...Did you come here to watch me?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... no, that's not it at all?"
#Shion
"Then... why...?"
#Satoshi
"...Because I'm worried about you, Shion-san."
I voiced my honest feelings.
#Satoshi
"It's partly because Tsujimura-san asked me to... but I can't just leave you be. Not someone living all alone in a place this far removed."
#Satoshi
"Besides... Ai-san was attacked around midday. You might be a target for the culprit too, Shion-san."
#Shion
"But, I..."
#Satoshi
"I'll definitely find the culprit. So... until then, I'll make sure to protect you, Shion-san."
Shion-san stayed silent and looked down.
#Satoshi
"Um... was I being a nuisance, perhaps...?"
#Shion
"...No, that's... not the case."
Shion-san shook her head.
#Satoshi
"Umm... sorry, I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself..."
#Shion
"No... th-thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"W-Well then, I'll be going..."
In that awkward atmosphere, I bowed and left Shion-san's room.
#Satoshi
"...Shion-san, could I ask you for just one thing?"
#Shion
"What is it...?"
#Satoshi
"...I'd like to hear that song from last night one more time."
#Shion
"Eh...?"
Shion-san's eyes widened in surprise.
And for good reason.
Anyone would be surprised if they were suddenly asked something like that.
#Shion
"My song...?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah... if you don't mind..."
#Shion
"...My apologies. Right now, I'm just not... in the mood for that..."
#Satoshi
"...You're right. Sorry, I shouldn't have asked such a strange thing..."
#Shion
"No..."
#Shion
"...Alright."
Shion-san nodded and steadied her breathing.
With just that, the air in the room grew tense and still.
After she finished singing, Shion-san bowed to me.
#Shion
"Um... was that alright...?"
#Satoshi
"Ah... thank you very much. It really... touched my heart."
#Shion
"Not at all..."
#Satoshi
"What kind of song is that?"
#Shion
"...I don't know."
Shion-san shook her head.
#Shion
"But... when I sing this song, I feel very calm."
#Satoshi
"It was a very good song."
#Shion
"Th-Thank you very much..."
#Satoshi
"Well then, I'll be going. Please let me hear it again sometime."
I offered my thanks to Shion-san and left her room.
