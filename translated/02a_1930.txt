When I stepped out of the office, the fierce blizzard was as intense as ever.
A faint trail of small footprints continued toward the tower.
Those are likely Shion-san's footprints.
I stepped into the tower.
Shion-san is on the second floor.
I went up the stairs and knocked on the door.
＃Shion
"Yes...?"
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san, it's me."
After I spoke, the door opened from the inside a moment later.
＃Shion
"Um... is something the matter...?"
Shion-san's eyes were moist.
I wonder if she’d been crying...
＃Protagonist
"I came to make sure that everyone is alright."
＃Shion
"...I see."
Shion-san looked down.
＃Protagonist
"Umm... so—"
＃Shion
"Please, come in..."
Shion-san opened the door and invited me inside.
＃Protagonist
"Ah... excuse me."
＃Shion
"...Did you come here to watch me?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... no, that's not it at all?"
＃Shion
"Then... why...?"
＃Protagonist
"...Because I'm worried about you, Shion-san."
I voiced my honest feelings.
＃Protagonist
"It's partly because Tsujimura-san asked me to... but I can't just leave you be. Not someone living all alone in a place this far removed."
＃Protagonist
"Besides... Ai-san was attacked around midday. You might be a target for the culprit too, Shion-san."
＃Shion
"But, I..."
＃Protagonist
"I'll definitely find the culprit. So... until then, I'll make sure to protect you, Shion-san."
Shion-san stayed silent and looked down.
＃Protagonist
"Um... was I being a nuisance, perhaps...?"
＃Shion
"...No, that's... not the case."
Shion-san shook her head.
＃Protagonist
"Umm... sorry, I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself..."
＃Shion
"No... th-thank you very much."
＃Protagonist
"W-Well then, I'll be going..."
In that awkward atmosphere, I bowed and left Shion-san's room.
＃Protagonist
"...Shion-san, could I ask you for just one thing?"
＃Shion
"What is it...?"
＃Protagonist
"...I'd like to hear that song from last night one more time."
＃Shion
"Eh...?"
Shion-san's eyes widened in surprise.
And for good reason.
Anyone would be surprised if they were suddenly asked something like that.
＃Shion
"My song...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... if you don't mind..."
＃Shion
"...My apologies. Right now, I'm just not... in the mood for that..."
＃Protagonist
"...You're right. Sorry, I shouldn't have asked such a strange thing..."
＃Shion
"No..."
＃Shion
"...Alright."
Shion-san nodded and steadied her breathing.
With just that, the air in the room grew tense and still.
After she finished singing, Shion-san bowed to me.
＃Shion
"Um... was that alright...?"
＃Protagonist
"Ah... thank you very much. It really... touched my heart."
＃Shion
"Not at all..."
＃Protagonist
"What kind of song is that?"
＃Shion
"...I don't know."
Shion-san shook her head.
＃Shion
"But... when I sing this song, I feel very calm."
＃Protagonist
"It was a very good song."
＃Shion
"Th-Thank you very much..."
＃Protagonist
"Well then, I'll be going. Please let me hear it again sometime."
I offered my thanks to Shion-san and left her room.
