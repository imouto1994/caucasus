"...Now that you mention it, you were saying something like that in the middle of the night, too. So what was it in the end?"

"No, I still haven't figured anything out yet."
#Souko
"Oh, I see."
#Maya
"A noise...? This is quite an old house, so it may simply be creaking somewhere."
#Protagonist

#Ai
"A noise in the middle of the night...? I’m sorry, I didn't hear a thing..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Benio
"You heard a noise in the middle of the night? Who has time to worry about every little sound?"
#Protagonist
"I guess you're right..."
#Tsujimura
"Regarding last night? I was joking about it being a mountain spirit, but it is a very old building... even if the soundproofing is quite solid."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Takamine
"A noise? No idea. I went straight to my room and fell asleep last night, so I didn't notice anything."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"A noise in the middle of the night, eh...? I didn't notice anything at all."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"A noise...? It was a blizzard last night, so the windows were rattling and groaning quite a bit."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Narumi
"A noise in the middle of the night? Maybe it was a ghost?"
#Protagonist
"...Well, it is the kind of building where one wouldn't be surprised if a ghost showed up."
