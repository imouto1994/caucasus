I wonder how long I’d been scraping away at the wall.
Suddenly, a hole gaped open with a dull thud.
＃Protagonist
「It's open...?」
I can see the room on the other side.
It appears to be the machine room.
＃Narumi
「Make the hole wider.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I know.」
My energy returned now that an exit was in sight.
I continued to frantically crumble the wall.
＃Narumi
「Whew... we finally got out.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
I stood up and stretched.
We managed to get out, but...
＃Protagonist
「Sigh...」
Emerging into the first-floor hall, I let out a long, heavy breath.
＃Narumi
「That was a nightmare, honestly...」
＃Protagonist
「In any case, we have to stop the culprit before they do anything else. Let’s patrol the mansion.」
＃Narumi
「Ah... h-hey...」
As I turned to begin my search, Narumi-san held me back.
＃Protagonist
「What is it?」
＃Narumi
「Aren't you going to suspect me? I mean... I'm a thief, you know?」
＃Protagonist
「You might be a thief, Narumi-san, but you aren't a murderer, are you? Besides, there’d be no point in you being locked in here with me.」
If Narumi-san were the killer... she would have finished me off while we were trapped.
＃Narumi
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「Let's hurry, Narumi-san.」
I left the first floor to Narumi-san and headed upstairs.
＃Protagonist
「Wait—?」
A strange noise.
I turned my gaze toward the source—the eastern corridor.
At the end of the hall.
The door to the performance room was open.
＃Protagonist
「—!? Benio-san!?」
I saw Benio-san collapsed on the floor and immediately started running.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san!」
＃Benio
「Guh... nnh...」
The fallen Benio-san grimaced and opened her eyes slightly.
Thank God—she's alive...
＃Protagonist
「A-Are you okay...?」
＃Benio
「...Of course I'm not okay, you idiot...」
Benio-san reached for the back of her head.
＃Benio
「Dammit... feels like I was hit from behind...」
＃Protagonist
「Please stay still. I'll go get Dr. Mikanagi—」
＃Benio
「...Wait.」
Benio-san tugged hard on my sleeve.
＃Protagonist
「What is it...?」
＃Benio
「...It just happened. That bastard might still be around.」
Benio-san whispered through a wince.
＃Protagonist
「...Do you know who hit you?」
I asked while keeping an eye on our surroundings.
＃Benio
「No... I don't know.」
There was no sign of anyone in the performance room.
There was nowhere to hide.
Just a grand piano sitting on the stage.
But surely... someone had to be here somewhere.
＃Benio
「But... take this—」
Benio-san pressed something into my hand.
＃Protagonist
「This is—?」
＃Souko
「What happened? What’s all the noise?」
Souko-san entered, apparently having heard the commotion.
＃Souko
「Benio-san...!?」
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san, be careful. The culprit might still be nearby.」
＃Souko
「Was she attacked...?」
＃Benio
「Nn... yeah...」
Benio-san answered sluggishly.
She seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness.
＃Souko
「...I'll go call Dr. Mikanagi.」
With that, Souko-san immediately left the room.
＃Protagonist
「Stay with us, Benio-san...!」
＃Benio
「...I'm fine.」
While this was happening, I felt like the person who attacked Benio-san was still close by, and I restlessly scanned the area.
Before long, Souko-san returned with Dr. Mikanagi.
＃Protagonist
「Dr. Mikanagi...!」
＃Mikanagi
「Make some room.」
Dr. Mikanagi knelt beside Benio-san and began his examination.
＃Mikanagi
「She might have a concussion. It's best not to move her for a while.」
He applied an ice pack to the back of Benio-san's head.
＃Souko
「...Did you see the culprit?」
＃Protagonist
「No... I only saw Benio-san right after she fell. I rushed over immediately... but the culprit wasn't there.」
＃Souko
「If they were going to hide—」
Souko-san looked around and pointed at two doors.
＃Souko
「There are two rooms you can reach directly from this performance room—the storage room for instruments and the sheet music room.」
＃Protagonist
「...Could they be inside...?」
＃Souko
「...Let's check. You take that one.」
Souko-san pointed to the door leading to the sheet music room.
I grabbed the doorknob and swallowed hard.
＃Souko
「Ready? On three!」
...There was no one inside.
I checked behind everything just in case, but there was nowhere for a person to hide.
I went back into the corridor.
Souko-san emerged from the opposite door at the same time.
＃Protagonist
「Not here...」
＃Souko
「Nothing on this side either. When on earth did they slip away...?」
Souko-san looked down the hallway.
Benio-san was still lying in the performance room.
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible they escaped through the window...?」
I went back inside and approached the window.
The snow had weakened, so I could just barely see outside.
＃Souko
「I don't think there was time to open that window and jump.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right... and if they went out this way, there would be tracks below...」
＃Souko
「They definitely used one of the adjacent rooms as an escape route. The question is when they slipped out... Do you remember anything?」
＃Protagonist
「I wasn't watching the corridor the whole time... Souko-san, did you notice anything from your room?」
＃Souko
「I only came out because I heard your voice... I didn't notice anything until then.」
＃Protagonist
「...So no one saw anyone leaving this area...」
No one left this room.
Did the culprit just vanish into thin air—?
＃Mikanagi
「Can I have a moment? I want to take Benio-san to the clinic...」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, I'll help.」
Overthinking wasn't going to get us anywhere.
For now, I should just be glad Benio-san is safe.
