Dr. Mikanagi, Tsujimura-san, and Souko-san all climbed up into the attic along with Akane-san.
＃Mikanagi
"...It seems her life is not in danger."
After a brief examination, Dr. Mikanagi gave his diagnosis.
＃Protagonist
"Thank God..."
＃Mikanagi
"Let's get her to the infirmary. Tsujimura-san, please give me a hand."
＃Tsujimura
"Of course."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, I can help too."
＃Mikanagi
"It's alright."
I offered, but the doctor waved me off.
＃Mikanagi
"It might be difficult to navigate the ladder while carrying someone, but I’d like you to stay here and examine the scene."
With that, Dr. Mikanagi hoisted Ai-san onto his back and left the room.
Souko-san and I were left alone in the attic.
＃Souko
"...Let’s look around. There must be some kind of clue left behind."
＃Protagonist
"...Right."
