I've come to the dining hall.
#Narumi
"Ah... did you find Kirihara-san?"
Narumi-san spoke to me.
#Protagonist
"No... not yet."
#Narumi
"I see..."
#Protagonist
"And Akane-san hasn't been found either..."
#Narumi
"Ah!?"
Narumi-san suddenly let out a startled cry.
#Protagonist
"Wh-What is it!?"
I look in the direction Narumi-san is staring, but I can only see the corridor through the dining hall door.
#Narumi
"Was that... Akane!?"
#Protagonist
"What!?"
I step out into the corridor with Narumi-san.
There's no sign of Akane-san anywhere.
#Narumi
"...She went into Akane's room."
Narumi-san approaches Akane-san's room.
#Protagonist
"We should check it out."
If Akane-san is up to something, I have to confront her.
#Narumi
"...The door's unlocked."
#Protagonist
"I'll open it."
I switch places with Narumi-san and put my hand on the doorknob.
Akane-san's room was no different from when I saw it before.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san...?"
She isn't anywhere in sight.
#Narumi
"...I'll check the bathroom."
Narumi-san opens the bathroom door and peeks inside.
#Narumi
"She doesn't seem to be here..."
#Protagonist
"Could it be..."
I approached the window.
The latch is undone in one spot.
When I open the window, the snow-covered ground outside had been disturbed.
#Protagonist
"Did she leave through here...?"
#Narumi
"...It looks like it."
Narumi-san clicks her tongue.
#Protagonist
"What could she be doing... I wonder if this has anything to do with Souko-san disappearing..."
#Narumi
"You'd have to be crazy to think it doesn't. I don't know what the cause is, though..."
We stepped out of the room.
#Narumi
"What are you going to do now?"
Narumi-san asked, having locked Akane-san's room just in case.
#Protagonist
"I'll try searching the mansion a bit more. I should probably search outside too, but..."
#Narumi
"Understood. Be careful."
#Protagonist
"...Yeah."
When I entered the dining hall, Narumi-san approached me with a worried expression.
#Narumi
"Well...?"
#Protagonist
"...I still haven't found her."
I shake my head.
#Narumi
"I see..."
#Protagonist
"Um, I'll try looking a bit more."
I turn on my heel and head back out into the corridor.
