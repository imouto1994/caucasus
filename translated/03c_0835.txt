I passed through the second-floor atrium and headed west.
I'll try talking to Benio-san.
#Main Character
"Benio-san, it's me."
#Benio
"What is it? What's wrong?"
#Main Character
"Have you seen Akane-san? She's been missing since this morning."
#Benio
"Akane...? Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her..."
#Main Character
"Do you know anything?"
#Benio
"Even if you ask me that..."
Benio-san fell into thought.
#Benio
"If we haven't seen her this morning, then there's a high probability she disappeared during the night..."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
#Benio
"If that's the case, I'm at a loss. Since you were here too, you couldn't have known anything either."
#Main Character
"...Yeah."
#Benio
"...Was she kidnapped by the killer...? If so, is she being held prisoner somewhere...?"
#Main Character
"...I'll find her as soon as possible."
#Benio
"Yeah. I'll help too."
#Main Character
"Thank you. Narumi-san is likely searching as well, so let's split up. I'll check the first floor."
#Benio
"Alright. See you later."
