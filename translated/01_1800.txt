Brushing the accumulated snow off our winter gear, we stepped inside the Nanatsuki-kan.
The entrance hall was spacious, with a vaulted ceiling that reached up to the second floor.
While there was little in the way of gaudy decoration, the furniture placed subtly throughout was clearly of high quality.
Unlike the exterior, it gave off a very calm impression.
Perhaps it was due to the monochrome color scheme.
Even so, to a commoner like me, the overwhelming feeling was that I had wandered into a place where I didn't belong.
I hesitated, wondering if it was really alright to step on this carpet with shoes still wet from the snowy path.
＃Benio
"I'll have a room prepared for you shortly. In the meantime, please make yourselves at home in the drawing room."
＃Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
It was just as I offered my thanks.
＃???
"Benio, are you back?"
A voice called out from above.
＃Benio
"Ah, Sister. I've just returned."
Benio-san looked up toward the second floor.
Following her gaze, I saw a woman descending the staircase that led from the second floor.
＃???
"I'm glad you made it back before the snow got any worse. And who are our guests?"
The woman looked at us and questioned Benio-san.
＃Benio
"Yes, they seemed to have lost their way in this snow. They intended to head for the village, but given the weather, I invited them here."
＃???
"I see... You must have had a difficult time."
＃Protagonist
"Thanks to her, we're safe."
＃???
"I am Ai, the eldest daughter of the Nanatsuki family."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, I'm Satoshi Kobayashi."
＃Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
＃Benio
"Sister, let's not keep them standing. I'd like to show them to the drawing room."
＃Ai
"Yes, of course. This way, please."
With that, Ai-san opened a door on the left.
Beyond the door, another hallway stretched out.
There were two doors on either side, and one large door at the very end.
Ai-san opened the door at the far left.
＃Ai
"Please, come in."
＃Protagonist
"Pardon me."
The room we were shown into appeared to be a drawing room.
A fire burned brightly in the fireplace set into the wall.
＃Benio
"I shall go and prepare some hot tea."
Benio-san left the room.
＃Ai
"Please, have a seat."
I sat down on the sofa as instructed.
＃Ai
"There aren't any other houses in this area, so I'm truly glad you found us. The blizzard will only get worse from here on out."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so?"
＃Ai
"Yes. Every year at this time, without fail, a violent blizzard arrives that lasts for several days."
Hearing that, I looked toward the window.
Even though the sun should have set by now, it was a wall of white; I couldn't see a thing.
Occasionally, the glass would creak and rattle.
＃Ai
"The local terrain likely plays a part, but some say it is the wrath of the mountain god."
＃Souko
"The god's wrath?"
＃Ai
"Yes... and some even call it a calamity brought upon the Nanatsuki family..."
＃Benio
"Sister, you'll frighten our guests speaking like that."
Benio-san returned with a tray of cups.
＃Benio
"Here, please have some tea."
＃Protagonist
"Thank you."
I cupped the tea in both hands.
The warmth slowly seeped into my numb hands.
＃Souko
"Is this blizzard part of the 'Nanatsuki Curse' as well?"
＃Benio
"It may well be. After all, it is said that Father even mentioned the curse in his will."
＃Ai
"Stop it, Benio!"
Ai-san scolded Benio-san with a sharp tone.
＃Benio
"It was a joke, Sister."
Benio-san laughed, covering her mouth.
It didn't sound like a joke at all to me...
Souko-san must have felt the same; she was staring intently at Benio-san.
＃Souko
"By 'Father,' do you mean Kousei Nanatsuki, who passed away recently?"
＃Ai
"Yes. You are quite well-informed."
＃Benio
"It seems they are researching the legends of the Nanatsuki family."
＃Ai
"The legends... well..."
Ai-san placed a hand to her mouth, looking troubled.
＃Ai
"Such matters aren't something to be spoken of lightly..."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, no, I'm sorry for prying like that."
I apologized before Souko-san could cut in.
A quick glance told me that, as expected, Souko-san looked displeased.
I just didn't want to cause trouble for the people who had helped us...
The door to the hallway opened.
＃Ai
"Ah... Mother."
Ai-san stood up and straightened her posture.
I instinctively started to stand as well, but the woman entering the room raised a hand slightly to stop me.
＃???
"Please, stay as you are."
Her expression was gentle, yet she carried an unmistakable air of authority.
＃???
"I am Maya Nanatsuki, the current head of this house. I heard you were stranded nearby. You must have had a harrowing ordeal."
＃Protagonist
"No, it wasn't quite as dire as being 'stranded,' really."
Although we certainly came close.
＃Maya
"I see. Please, do make yourselves comfortable here."
＃Souko
"Please, don't trouble yourself. I apologize for intruding so soon after the passing of Kousei-shi."
For once, Souko-san gave a proper response and bowed her head.
When she acts like this, she really seems like a cool, reliable senior.
＃Maya
"Oh? You were acquainted with my husband?"
＃Souko
"I've only had the pleasure of listening to some of his musical compositions."
＃Maya
"He would have been delighted to hear that."
Maya-san lightly dabbed at the corners of her eyes.
＃Protagonist
"...Was he famous?"
＃Souko
"In a way. He's the kind of artist where those in the know really appreciate his work, though a boy like you probably wouldn't listen to it."
I had assumed Souko-san just happened to pick up some trivia about him while looking into Nanatsuki Village.
＃Ai
"...In recent years, he became quite unable to compose music, and because of that...!"
Ai-san bit her lip, cutting herself off.
＃Souko
"And because of that?"
＃Benio
"He committed suicide."
Benio-san finished the sentence nonchalantly.
＃Ai
"Benio!"
Ai-san grabbed Benio-san's sleeve.
＃Maya
"Let it be, Ai. It is simply the truth."
Maya-san reproved Ai-san with a gentle voice.
＃Souko
"He took his own life?"
＃Maya
"...Yes. My husband was stricken with illness and did not have long to live. One morning, when I went to his room, he was already..."
＃Souko
"...I see. I'm sorry for asking."
＃Maya
"Don't be. ...By the way, how long do the two of you intend to stay with us?"
＃Protagonist
"Um... we plan to head out as soon as the blizzard lets up."
＃Benio
"I don't think it will stop for a while yet."
Benio-san murmured while looking out the window.
＃Maya
"Indeed. ...I'll have rooms prepared for you, so please feel free to stay as long as you like."
＃Protagonist
"But... wouldn't we be a burden?"
Even if she told me 'as long as I liked,' it was a bit overwhelming.
＃Maya
"Oh, I know. You both simply must attend the wedding ceremony."
＃Protagonist
"Eh!? A-A wedding...?"
Being told that so out of the blue...
＃Ai
"It's not a formal affair by any means. It's more of a small ritual held only among relatives."
＃Protagonist
"But wouldn't it be an intrusion for us to be there?"
＃Benio
"Not at all. ...If you wish to research this place, I believe it's something you really should see."
Benio-san whispered that into Souko-san's ear.
＃Souko
"Does it have something to do with our research?"
Souko-san asked back with a dubious look.
＃Benio
"Of course. It's a very unusual custom."
＃Souko
"I see. ...In that case, would it be alright if we joined you? Ah, but our clothes are like this..."
It seemed even Souko-san thought it would be bad form to attend a ceremony in everyday clothes.
＃Maya
"Hehe... I don't mind in the least."
＃Protagonist
"Eh, are you sure?"
＃Maya
"As long as you remain quiet during the ritual, there will be no problem."
＃Souko
"I understand. Thank you for having us."
Souko-san bowed.
＃Ai
"The wedding rite begins at midnight, so please relax until then."
＃Protagonist
"Thank you very much."
＃Maya
"Now then, I have preparations to attend to. Ai, Benio, please show our guests around the interior."
＃Benio
"Understood, Mother."
With a graceful bow, Maya-san left the room.
＃Protagonist
"She's a beautiful woman."
I whispered softly to Souko-san beside me.
＃Souko
"Indeed. She looks so young, it's hard to believe she's the mother of these two... Oh, and whose wedding is it?"
Souko-san asked the two sisters.
＃Ai
"Our youngest sister's."
＃Benio
"We are three sisters, you see."
＃Souko
"And where is she now?"
＃Ai
"Since it's before the ceremony, she should be waiting in her room. We'll introduce you later if there's a chance."
＃Benio
"Yes. But before that, we shall give you a tour of the mansion."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, right. Thank you."
＃Ai
"Should I or Benio show you around?"
Hmm... who should I ask?
Ask Ai
Ask Benio
＃Protagonist
"Then, Ai-san, would you mind?"
＃Ai
"Certainly, I don't mind at all."
＃Benio
"I shall go and prepare for the ceremony. Until later, then."
Benio-san left the room.
＃Ai
"Shall we go?"
Following Ai-san, we stood up from the sofa and left the drawing room.
＃Protagonist
"In that case, Benio-san, if you please."
＃Benio
"Understood."
Benio-san smiled.
＃Ai
"Then, I'll take my leave for now. See you later."
Ai-san left the room.
＃Benio
"Shall we be off as well?"
Guided by Benio-san, we departed from the drawing room.
