When I came down the stairs, I heard loud voices coming from the dining room.
＃Protagonist
"Sounds like it's over there."
＃Souko
"I wonder what happened..."
As soon as we stepped into the eastern corridor, the smell of burning hit my nose.
＃Souko
"What... is this?"
Souko-san muttered, covering her mouth.
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san, what happened?"
I called out to Narumi-san, who was in front of the kitchen.
＃Narumi
"It seems... something suddenly exploded in the kitchen... and Akane..."
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san!?"
I hurriedly peered into the kitchen.
＃Protagonist
"Ugh..."
The inside of the kitchen was a total mess.
Scorched marks were everywhere, and large shelves and cooking tables had been knocked over.
＃Souko
"This smell... was it a gas explosion...?"
Souko-san muttered as she saw the scene.
＃Protagonist
"More importantly, where is Akane-san!?"
＃Narumi
"Calm down. She wouldn't be okay if she were in here, would she?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... is she safe...?"
＃Narumi
"Tsujimura-san is looking at her in her room now. It seems like just minor burns and she hit her head."
＃Protagonist
"I... I see..."
Thank goodness...
If she had been caught in an explosion like this, she wouldn't have escaped unharmed.
＃Souko
"Do you know what happened?"
Souko-san asked Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
"I just ran here when I heard the explosion, so I don't know much, but it seems it happened when she tried to open the kitchen door."
＃Narumi
"Akane was lying in the corridor, and the door was mangled."
Narumi-san pointed to the kitchen door.
＃Souko
"So she wasn't directly caught in the explosion?"
＃Narumi
"Yeah, most likely."
The sound of footsteps running down the corridor approached.
＃Mikanagi
"What happened!? Ugh..."
Dr. Mikanagi frowned as he entered the kitchen.
＃Narumi
"Doctor, Akane's been hurt. Please go to her room."
＃Mikanagi
"A-Ah, right..."
Dr. Mikanagi left.
＃Protagonist
"I'll go check on her too."
＃Souko
"Right. I'll stay here and look around a bit."
