When I came down the stairs, I heard loud voices coming from the dining room.
#Main Character
"Sounds like it's over there."
#Souko
"I wonder what happened..."
As soon as we stepped into the eastern corridor, the smell of burning hit my nose.
#Souko
"What... is this?"
Souko-san muttered, covering her mouth.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, what happened?"
I called out to Narumi-san, who was in front of the kitchen.
#Narumi
"It seems... something suddenly exploded in the kitchen... and Akane..."
#Main Character
"Akane-san!?"
I hurriedly peered into the kitchen.
#Main Character
"Ugh..."
The inside of the kitchen was a total mess.
Scorched marks were everywhere, and large shelves and cooking tables had been knocked over.
#Souko
"This smell... was it a gas explosion...?"
Souko-san muttered as she saw the scene.
#Main Character
"More importantly, where is Akane-san!?"
#Narumi
"Calm down. She wouldn't be okay if she were in here, would she?"
#Main Character
"Eh... is she safe...?"
#Narumi
"Tsujimura-san is looking at her in her room now. It seems like just minor burns and she hit her head."
#Main Character
"I... I see..."
Thank goodness...
If she had been caught in an explosion like this, she wouldn't have escaped unharmed.
#Souko
"Do you know what happened?"
Souko-san asked Narumi-san.
#Narumi
"I just ran here when I heard the explosion, so I don't know much, but it seems it happened when she tried to open the kitchen door."
#Narumi
"Akane was lying in the corridor, and the door was mangled."
Narumi-san pointed to the kitchen door.
#Souko
"So she wasn't directly caught in the explosion?"
#Narumi
"Yeah, most likely."
The sound of footsteps running down the corridor approached.
#Mikanagi
"What happened!? Ugh..."
Dr. Mikanagi frowned as he entered the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Doctor, Akane's been hurt. Please go to her room."
#Mikanagi
"A-Ah, right..."
Dr. Mikanagi left.
#Main Character
"I'll go check on her too."
#Souko
"Right. I'll stay here and look around a bit."
