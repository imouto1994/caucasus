＃Shion
「Kyaaah!?」
I grabbed her hair and slammed her body down onto the bed.
＃Shion
「I-It hurts...!」
＃Protagonist
「You were the one who did it, weren't you!?」
I couldn't forgive her, no matter what.
＃Protagonist
「Why... even Souko-san...!」
＃Shion
「I-I would never—!?」
I slapped her across the cheek.
＃Shion
「Augh!!」
＃Protagonist
「Who else could it be!? You killed everyone!!」
＃Shion
「Uugh...!」
Her cheek turned a bright red.
Terror was reflected in her eyes as she looked up at me through her tears.
＃Shion
「W... why...」
＃Protagonist
「I'm the one who wants to ask that!? Why did you kill them!!」
＃Shion
「Uugh...! T-That is...」
She faltered.
＃Protagonist
「You can't even say it... even though you're the one who murdered them!」
I slapped her cheek again and again.
Even when the corner of her mouth split and blood began to seep out, she refused to answer with a reason.
＃Protagonist
「Do you truly intend to never answer...?」
She wouldn't even look at me.
If that's how you want to play it—I have my own ideas.
＃Protagonist
「Ngh... you bitch!」
＃Shion
「Kyaaah!!」
I used all my strength to rip open the front of her clothes.
Her small breasts tumbled out.
＃Protagonist
「Are you still not going to talk...?」
I squeezed her breasts hard enough to crush them.
＃Shion
「...Ngh.」
She grimaced in pain.
＃Shion
「I... I can't say, I never will...」
Still, she refused to open her mouth.
＃Protagonist
「Dammit—」
While roughly kneading her breasts, I struck her with my open palm again and again.
＃Shion
「Nn-ah...!」
＃Protagonist
「...Listen, Shion-san. I used to think of myself as a patient person.」
＃Protagonist
「But... it's no use without Souko-san. She was the one who kept me in check just enough.」
I was shedding tears even as I spoke to her.
＃Protagonist
「That's why I...! I can never forgive you for being a murderer...!」
Without hesitation, I brought my fist down.
＃Shion
「Ngh!!」
＃Protagonist
「Why... why!!」
Again and again.
I slammed my fist into her face.
＃Shion
「Nn-ah... ha, uugh...」
She groaned in agony, blood streaming from her nose.
＃Protagonist
「Why would you do something like murder...!」
She didn't answer.
That only irritated me further, leading me to swing my fist again.
＃Shion
「U... uugh...」
She turned a face wet with tears and blood toward me.
That expression, painted in terror, drove my sadistic impulses.
＃Protagonist
「You...!」
My body grew hot every time I struck her.
I ripped her skirt away as well.
Her underwear was revealed.
Whether out of tension or fear, she was squeezing her thighs tight.
I forcibly pried her legs open and shoved my body between them.
＃Shion
「Nngh...!」
＃Protagonist
「Hah, hah, hah...」
I pulled down my pants, breathing heavily.
My raging cock burst out.
I stripped away the underwear hiding her lower body.
I rubbed my penis against her exposed labia.
＃Shion
「Uuugh...」
Her body tensed up.
I forced my meat pole into her, where there wasn't a drop of lubrication.
＃Shion
「A... aaah! I-It hurts...!!」
She let out a scream.
Undeterred, I continued to shove my cock deep inside.
＃Shion
「A... aguh! Uu, aaah...!」
The vaginal canal was forced open with a wet sound as my shaft was swallowed.
＃Shion
「No... a-aaah...!」
＃Protagonist
「Does it hurt...? But the people you killed must have hurt even more...」
I spat the words at her while rocking my body.
＃Shion
「Uu, uugh...!」
My cock was completely buried inside her.
Her vaginal canal, not loosened at all, was incredibly tight, squeezing my shaft with a crushing grip.
＃Shion
「A... guh, uugh...」
Showing no further resistance, she let her body go limp.
She must have realized that only pain remained for her.
I grabbed her waist with both hands and began to rock my body.
＃Shion
「Nnh... guh, uuh... nn...」
There wasn't a hint of pleasure in her groans.
I wasn't feeling any pleasure either.
I simply wanted to torment her body and soul.
＃Protagonist
「Dammit... dammit!」
I moved my hips while hurling curses.
＃Shion
「Ngh... ah, hah... nngh...」
Her limp body swayed with me.
Still, she grimaced occasionally, as if in pain.
＃Shion
「Nn, guh... a-nnh... ha, ah...」
Gradually, the thrusting became smoother.
In accordance with that, a touch of heat began to mix into her voice.
＃Shion
「Nnh, uu, ha, ah... nnh! Fu, nnh... auh!」
＃Protagonist
「Even after this... are you actually feeling it...?」
＃Shion
「Nn-ah, th-this is... nngh!」
I flicked her clitoris with my finger.
＃Shion
「Hiah, ah, nngh...! Ah, ha, nngh...!」
Seeing her react so violently, her body arching back, I couldn't suppress the dark emotions welling up inside me.
＃Protagonist
「I'll... I'll ruin you even more...!」
＃Shion
「Ha... ah! Nngh, uugh! Ah, ha, nn-ah!」
I thrust my hips frantically, ravaging the inside of her vagina.
＃Shion
「Nnh, ah, hah, fu... ah, aaahh!」
＃Protagonist
「It's your fault... that's why!」
＃Shion
「Nngh, ah, gu... uuuugh!」
I even grew angry at her vaginal walls, which were becoming slick due to physiological reactions.
＃Protagonist
「Feeling this... after what's been done... aren't you ashamed of yourself...!?」
＃Shion
「Th-That... auh!」
Her body jumped and twitched.
＃Protagonist
「Dammit... why, why is it like this...!」
＃Shion
「Faah, ah, nn-ah! Ha, ku, uu, nngh!」
My inserted shaft was squeezed tight.
＃Protagonist
「Ngh... I'm going to finish... right inside you...」
＃Shion
「Nngh, ah, th-that... ah, no, nnh, fu... a-aaahhh!!」
With her scream, I slammed my essence into her vagina.
＃Shion
「Ah... no... not inside... nngh...」
＃Protagonist
「Hah, hah, hah...」
I squeezed every last drop of semen from my scrotum, defiling her depths.
＃Shion
「Uu... uuugh...」
Strength completely left her body.
＃Protagonist
「...The suffering of the people you killed was nothing compared to this...」
I whispered to her while we were still connected.
＃Protagonist
「It might not be my place to punish you. But... if you have even a shred of a desire for atonement—」
Her hand, which had been hanging limply to the floor, rose up.
There, I saw—
＃Protagonist
「Eh—」
A small knife—was that what it was?
Right now, it was firmly embedded in my neck.
It hurt with a searing heat.
Blood dripped down onto her body pinned beneath me.
＃Protagonist
「Wh... y...」
She didn't let a single emotion show on her face.
When I tried to reach for her arm, the pain in my neck became unspeakably intense.
She had twisted her wrist.
The overflowing blood increased.
＃Protagonist
「I... I knew it, you were—」
The strength to support my own weight vanished, and I collapsed on top of her.
Her hand brushed past my fading vision and reached around my neck.
＃Shion
「It's okay—I don't intend to kill you—」
Even if you say that...
With this much blood coming out... there's no way I won't die—
