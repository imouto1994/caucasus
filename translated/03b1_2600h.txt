#Shion
"Kyaaah!?"
I grabbed her hair and slammed her body down onto the bed.
#Shion
"I-It hurts...!"
#Main Character
"You were the one who did it, weren't you!?"
I couldn't forgive her, no matter what.
#Main Character
"Why... even Souko-san...!"
#Shion
"I-I would never—!?"
I slapped her across the cheek.
#Shion
"Augh!!"
#Main Character
"Who else could it be!? You killed everyone!!"
#Shion
"Uugh...!"
Her cheek turned a bright red.
Terror was reflected in her eyes as she looked up at me through her tears.
#Shion
"W... why..."
#Main Character
"I'm the one who wants to ask that!? Why did you kill them!!"
#Shion
"Uugh...! T-That is..."
She faltered.
#Main Character
"You can't even say it... even though you're the one who murdered them!"
I slapped her cheek again and again.
Even when the corner of her mouth split and blood began to seep out, she refused to answer with a reason.
#Main Character
"Do you truly intend to never answer...?"
She wouldn't even look at me.
If that's how you want to play it—I have my own ideas.
#Main Character
"Ngh... you bitch!"
#Shion
"Kyaaah!!"
I used all my strength to rip open the front of her clothes.
Her small breasts tumbled out.
#Main Character
"Are you still not going to talk...?"
I squeezed her breasts hard enough to crush them.
#Shion
"...Ngh."
She grimaced in pain.
#Shion
"I... I can't say, I never will..."
Still, she refused to open her mouth.
#Main Character
"Dammit—"
While roughly kneading her breasts, I struck her with my open palm again and again.
#Shion
"Nn-ah...!"
#Main Character
"...Listen, Shion-san. I used to think of myself as a patient person."
#Main Character
"But... it's no use without Souko-san. She was the one who kept me in check just enough."
I was shedding tears even as I spoke to her.
#Main Character
"That's why I...! I can never forgive you for being a murderer...!"
Without hesitation, I brought my fist down.
#Shion
"Ngh!!"
#Main Character
"Why... why!!"
Again and again.
I slammed my fist into her face.
#Shion
"Nn-ah... ha, uugh..."
She groaned in agony, blood streaming from her nose.
#Main Character
"Why would you do something like murder...!"
She didn't answer.
That only irritated me further, leading me to swing my fist again.
#Shion
"U... uugh..."
She turned a face wet with tears and blood toward me.
That expression, painted in terror, drove my sadistic impulses.
#Main Character
"You...!"
My body grew hot every time I struck her.
I ripped her skirt away as well.
Her underwear was revealed.
Whether out of tension or fear, she was squeezing her thighs tight.
I forcibly pried her legs open and shoved my body between them.
#Shion
"Nngh...!"
#Main Character
"Hah, hah, hah..."
I pulled down my pants, breathing heavily.
My raging cock burst out.
I stripped away the underwear hiding her lower body.
I rubbed my penis against her exposed labia.
#Shion
"Uuugh..."
Her body tensed up.
I forced my meat pole into her, where there wasn't a drop of lubrication.
#Shion
"A... aaah! I-It hurts...!!"
She let out a scream.
Undeterred, I continued to shove my cock deep inside.
#Shion
"A... aguh! Uu, aaah...!"
The vaginal canal was forced open with a wet sound as my shaft was swallowed.
#Shion
"No... a-aaah...!"
#Main Character
"Does it hurt...? But the people you killed must have hurt even more..."
I spat the words at her while rocking my body.
#Shion
"Uu, uugh...!"
My cock was completely buried inside her.
Her vaginal canal, not loosened at all, was incredibly tight, squeezing my shaft with a crushing grip.
#Shion
"A... guh, uugh..."
Showing no further resistance, she let her body go limp.
She must have realized that only pain remained for her.
I grabbed her waist with both hands and began to rock my body.
#Shion
"Nnh... guh, uuh... nn..."
There wasn't a hint of pleasure in her groans.
I wasn't feeling any pleasure either.
I simply wanted to torment her body and soul.
#Main Character
"Dammit... dammit!"
I moved my hips while hurling curses.
#Shion
"Ngh... ah, hah... nngh..."
Her limp body swayed with me.
Still, she grimaced occasionally, as if in pain.
#Shion
"Nn, guh... a-nnh... ha, ah..."
Gradually, the thrusting became smoother.
In accordance with that, a touch of heat began to mix into her voice.
#Shion
"Nnh, uu, ha, ah... nnh! Fu, nnh... auh!"
#Main Character
"Even after this... are you actually feeling it...?"
#Shion
"Nn-ah, th-this is... nngh!"
I flicked her clitoris with my finger.
#Shion
"Hiah, ah, nngh...! Ah, ha, nngh...!"
Seeing her react so violently, her body arching back, I couldn't suppress the dark emotions welling up inside me.
#Main Character
"I'll... I'll ruin you even more...!"
#Shion
"Ha... ah! Nngh, uugh! Ah, ha, nn-ah!"
I thrust my hips frantically, ravaging the inside of her vagina.
#Shion
"Nnh, ah, hah, fu... ah, aaahh!"
#Main Character
"It's your fault... that's why!"
#Shion
"Nngh, ah, gu... uuuugh!"
I even grew angry at her vaginal walls, which were becoming slick due to physiological reactions.
#Main Character
"Feeling this... after what's been done... aren't you ashamed of yourself...!?"
#Shion
"Th-That... auh!"
Her body jumped and twitched.
#Main Character
"Dammit... why, why is it like this...!"
#Shion
"Faah, ah, nn-ah! Ha, ku, uu, nngh!"
My inserted shaft was squeezed tight.
#Main Character
"Ngh... I'm going to finish... right inside you..."
#Shion
"Nngh, ah, th-that... ah, no, nnh, fu... a-aaahhh!!"
With her scream, I slammed my essence into her vagina.
#Shion
"Ah... no... not inside... nngh..."
#Main Character
"Hah, hah, hah..."
I squeezed every last drop of semen from my scrotum, defiling her depths.
#Shion
"Uu... uuugh..."
Strength completely left her body.
#Main Character
"...The suffering of the people you killed was nothing compared to this..."
I whispered to her while we were still connected.
#Main Character
"It might not be my place to punish you. But... if you have even a shred of a desire for atonement—"
Her hand, which had been hanging limply to the floor, rose up.
There, I saw—
#Main Character
"Eh—"
A small knife—was that what it was?
Right now, it was firmly embedded in my neck.
It hurt with a searing heat.
Blood dripped down onto her body pinned beneath me.
#Main Character
"Wh... y..."
She didn't let a single emotion show on her face.
When I tried to reach for her arm, the pain in my neck became unspeakably intense.
She had twisted her wrist.
The overflowing blood increased.
#Main Character
"I... I knew it, you were—"
The strength to support my own weight vanished, and I collapsed on top of her.
Her hand brushed past my fading vision and reached around my neck.
#Shion
"It's okay—I don't intend to kill you—"
Even if you say that...
With this much blood coming out... there's no way I won't die—
