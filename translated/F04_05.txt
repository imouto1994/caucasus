The office was dark as well, as expected.
Benio-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Benio-san, this blackout...?"
＃Benio
"Tsujimura should be down in the basement checking the generator right now."
＃Protagonist
"There's a generator?"
＃Benio
"Yeah. There should be fuel for it, so it's likely some kind of trouble... I don't like this."
Benio-san spat the words out irritably.
＃Protagonist
"...It's certainly unsettling, given the current situation."
＃Benio
"It could be that someone did this with malicious intent. Don't let your guard down."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, I know. You be careful too, Benio-san."
Leaving her with those words, I decided to exit the office.
I’ve returned to the office.
＃Protagonist
"Has Tsujimura-san still not returned?"
I spoke to Benio-san, who was alone in the office.
＃Benio
"Honestly... you just left a second ago."
Benio-san sighed in exasperation.
＃Protagonist
"Well, yes, but... I don't know, I was just concerned..."
＃Benio
"Panicking won't help anything."
＃Protagonist
"You're right... sorry to bother you."
I bowed and decided to leave the office.
When I entered the office, Benio-san and Shion-san were there along with Tsujimura-san.
However... Tsujimura-san was pressing a wet hand towel to his head.
＃Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, what happened!?"
＃Tsujimura
"Oh, how embarrassing... it seems I was struck by someone..."
＃Protagonist
"Eh... when did this happen?"
＃Tsujimura
"About twenty minutes ago, I suppose... I was in the hall when I was suddenly hit from behind... ow..."
＃Shion
"Seiji-san, please don't move too much..."
Shion-san, who was gently holding the towel in place, spoke up.
＃Tsujimura
"Dear me, how pathetic of me..."
＃Protagonist
"Um, do you have any idea who did it?"
＃Tsujimura
"I haven't the slightest clue... after all, it came from behind..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Ah, also, the cause of the blackout was a blown fuse in the basement generator."
＃Protagonist
"A fuse?"
＃Tsujimura
"I didn't see any other broken lines, so I don't think it was intentional, but..."
Tsujimura-san seemed concerned about that as well.
＃Benio
"So, just how much longer must we spend our time in the dark?"
＃Tsujimura
"...If I recall, there should be spare fuses left in the storage room. If I find those first... it might be after six o'clock."
＃Benio
"Hmm..."
Benio-san looked at the clock and fell silent.
＃Shion
"Um, Seiji-san. You've injured your head, so it would be better if you didn't move around..."
＃Tsujimura
"...But, if I don't fix it..."
＃Protagonist
"Um, I'll help you."
＃Tsujimura
"B-But... I couldn't possibly let a guest do such a thing..."
＃Benio
"Tsujimura, just take him up on his offer. I know absolutely nothing about machinery, and it's best if you don't move."
＃Protagonist
"I'll be fine."
＃Tsujimura
"Is that so... my apologies."
Tsujimura-san tried to bow his head but was stopped by Shion-san.
＃Shion
"...Please, just stay still for now."
＃Tsujimura
"Haha... I'm sorry."
＃Protagonist
"Um, so what should I do?"
＃Tsujimura
"There should be replacement fuses and tools in the storage room. If you could use those to fix the generator in the basement..."
＃Protagonist
"Understood, leave it to me."
First, the storage room.
I bowed to Tsujimura-san and the others and decided to leave the office.
＃Benio
"Hm, haven't you left yet?"
Benio-san and the others were still in the office.
＃Protagonist
"Ah, no, I didn't really have any business, but..."
＃Benio
"Hurry up and fix that generator. I can't stand it being this dark."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, I know."
I turned on my heel and decided to leave the office.
When I entered the office, Takamine-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Oh... Takamine-san."
＃Takamine
"...It's you. What on earth is happening?"
＃Protagonist
"It seems there's a blackout."
＃Takamine
"...I see. Since when?"
＃Protagonist
"...The power went out a little before five-thirty, but did you not notice until now?"
＃Takamine
"...I was asleep in my room. I woke up to find the lights wouldn't turn on, so I came here to ask Tsujimura-san about it."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Takamine
"...Something seems to be up."
Takamine-san muttered under his breath.
＃Protagonist
"You're right."
I nodded too.
A blackout in the middle of such a bizarre situation is just too convenient.
＃Takamine
"It would be wise not to let your guard down."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah. I'm going to look around the building a bit more."
＃Takamine
"I see. I'll stay here for a while longer."
I bowed to Takamine-san and left the area.
Takamine-san was still in the office.
＃Takamine
"What is it?"
＃Protagonist
"No... I didn't really have any business, but..."
＃Takamine
"You shouldn't wander around too much. There's no telling where the culprit might be lurking."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... I'm being careful."
＃Takamine
"Locking yourself in your room is the best course... come to think of it, did I lock my door...?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... isn't that dangerous?"
＃Takamine
"If I know there's danger right in front of me, there are plenty of ways to handle it. As long as I'm not caught off guard, I'll be fine."
＃Protagonist
"Well, you do have the most solid build among us, Takamine-san..."
I don't think I could win even if I challenged this man head-on.
Actually, I don't think someone like me could take him even if I caught him off guard.
＃Protagonist
"W-Well then, I'll be going."
＃Takamine
"Yeah."
I decided to leave the office.
