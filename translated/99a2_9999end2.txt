We returned to Tokyo and went back to our peaceful daily lives.
When summer came, I was walking down the street when a familiar person passed before me.
#Main Character
"Ah... Ai-san?"
#Ai
"Yes? Oh... it's been a long time."
#Main Character
"It's rare to run into you in a place like this."
#Ai
"Yes, I have some business to attend to."
#Main Character
"I see."
#Ai
"Um... would you like to talk for a bit?"
#Main Character
"Sure, I don't mind. Are you out looking for books again?"
#Ai
"Y-Yes, well..."
We were walking in Jinbocho, Kanda.
#Ai
"……I want to send some books to Shion."
#Main Character
"I see... what kind of books?"
#Ai
"I was thinking of Dostoevsky..."
#Main Character
"For translations, that bookstore over there is good. They have most things in stock."
#Ai
"You're quite knowledgeable."
#Main Character
"Well... I like books too."
#Ai
"Fufu... that's right."
Ai-san smiled.
I'm glad... she seems to have settled down considerably.
#Ai
"——I heard that Shion is pregnant."
Ai-san blurted it out quite abruptly.
#Main Character
"Eh——?"
#Ai
"She hasn't told anyone who the father is... but giggle, even if she hides it, I know. The father of the child in her belly is——"
#Main Character
"Who is it...?"
#Ai
"——Oh, right, actually, I also..."
With that, Ai-san placed a hand on her own stomach.
#Main Character
"Whaaat!?"
#Ai
"Will you... take responsibility? If it's now, I can even offer you the seat of the head of the Nanatsuki family, you know?"
#Main Character
"Eh... um, I'd love to take responsibility, but the seat of the head is a bit..."
#Ai
"In that case, let us elope. Yes, that sounds wonderful."
#Main Character
"Wait, wait a minute...!?"
#Ai
"Of course, it will be after I send the things to my beloved Shion. Let's see... how about going abroad?"
#Main Character
"U-Um..."
It seemed that, before I knew it, I might have been caught in a Jorogumo's web...
