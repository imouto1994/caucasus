We arrived in front of Ai-san's room.

"I think it's fine now, but please try to stay in your room as much as possible, okay?"
＃Ai
"Okay..."
Ai-san placed her hand on her door.
＃Ai
"...Thank you so much, truly."
With a bow, she disappeared inside her room.
＃Protagonist
"Now then—"
The only one whose safety I haven't confirmed is Shion-san, I suppose.
Nobody seems to be making a fuss, so she's likely fine, but I'll go make sure just in case.
