When I step out of the office, the fierce blizzard is as intense as ever.
A faint trail of small footprints continues toward the tower.
Those are likely Shion-san's footprints.
I step into the tower.
Shion-san is on the second floor.
I go up the stairs and knock on the door.
#Shion
"Yes……?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san, it's me."
After I call out, the door opens from the inside a moment later.
#Shion
"Um…… is something the matter……?"
Shion-san's eyes are moist.
I wonder if she’s been crying……
#Satoshi
"I came to make sure that everyone is alright."
#Shion
"……I see."
Shion-san looks down.
#Satoshi
"Umm…… so——"
#Shion
"Please, come in……"
Shion-san opens the door and invites me inside.
#Satoshi
"Ah…… excuse me."
#Shion
"……Did you come here to watch me?"
#Satoshi
"Eh…… no, that's not it at all?"
#Shion
"Then…… why……?"
#Satoshi
"……Because I'm worried about you, Shion-san."
I voice my honest feelings.
#Satoshi
"It's partly because Tsujimura-san asked me to…… but I can't just leave you be. Not someone living all alone in a place this far removed."
#Satoshi
"Besides…… Ai-san has been murdered as well. You might be a target for the culprit too, Shion-san."
#Shion
"But, I……"
#Satoshi
"I'll definitely find the culprit. So…… until then, I'll make sure to protect you, Shion-san."
Shion-san stays silent and looks down.
#Satoshi
"Um…… was I being a nuisance, perhaps……?"
#Shion
"……No, that's…… not the case."
Shion-san shakes her head.
#Satoshi
"Umm…… sorry, I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself……"
#Shion
"No…… th-thank you very much."
#Satoshi
"W-Well then, I'll be going……"
In that awkward atmosphere, I bow and leave Shion-san's room.
