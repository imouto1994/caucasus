After that, I tied Maya-san's arms behind her back and asked Tsujimura-san to keep watch while we confined her to her room.
Once dawn broke, Takamine-san headed for the destroyed suspension bridge, spoke with the driver who had come from the foot of the mountain, and brought back the police and workers to fix the bridge.
Right now, they're in the middle of constructing a temporary bridge for people to cross.
＃Akane
"Here, I've made some tea."
Akane-san entered the hall.
＃Protagonist
"Ah, thank you. I'll have some."
＃Akane
"Narumi-san is making some simple dishes now."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Akane
"...We can finally go home."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... but what are you all going to do now, Akane-san?"
＃Akane
"Eh, us...?"
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san will likely be arrested. And besides, everyone else is gone..."
＃Akane
"True... we might have to leave as well..."
Akane-san whispered with a hint of sadness, as if she had some lingering regret.
＃Protagonist
"...Where were you born, Akane-san?"
＃Akane
"...A small port town across several mountains from here. But... there's no one left there. I have nowhere to go."
＃Protagonist
"In... in that case—"
＃Souko
"Hey there, no picking up girls."
Souko-san poked me from behind.
＃Protagonist
"I-I wasn't trying to do anything like that—"
＃Narumi
"I'll take Akane in if she needs it."
Narumi-san, who had just entered the hall, spoke up.
＃Akane
"Eh... but... is that okay?"
＃Narumi
"Of course. ...Well, I've already moved out of my previous place, though. Shall we look for a new one together?"
＃Akane
"Y-Yes!"
Akane-san nodded, her eyes filling with tears.
＃Protagonist
"...By the way, Souko-san, what are you going to do now?"
＃Souko
"Well... since there's no point in investigating anymore, I could just go home... but I'll probably be called in by the police..."
＃Protagonist
"...Well, I suppose so."
＃Narumi
"Shouldn't you find an inn at the foot of the mountain or in town? They won't be doing the interrogations here, after all."
＃Souko
"True..."
＃Protagonist
"Why not just stay here?"
＃Souko
"I can't do that. ...I'm all out of cola."
Souko-san groaned, as if that were the most serious problem of all.
The door opened and Takamine-san entered.
＃Takamine
"The bridge is ready. Only one person can cross at a time, though."
＃Narumi
"I guess this is goodbye, then."
＃Protagonist
"I suppose so."
＃Akane
"Um... take care."
＃Souko
"You too. Well, let's go."
Souko-san called my name, and I stood up.
＃Protagonist
"Well then... thank you for everything."
