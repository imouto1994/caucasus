—5:30 AM, while it was still dark.
The door opened softly.
Someone slipped into the room.
They slowly approached the bed, where the covers were lumped up.
In their hand... a knife, its tip gleaming dully.
The hand reached out to check inside the blankets.
#Benio
"—That's far enough."
Benio-san's voice echoed through the dark room.
#???
"—!?"
#Benio
"You can come out now."
At Benio-san's word, I emerged from beneath the covers.
#Main Character
"...I really didn't want you to come here..."
I said, addressing her.
#Benio
"Drop the knife."
Seemingly resigned, she dropped the knife onto the floor.
#Main Character
"Benio-san, please go call the others."
#Benio
"The doctor is already taking care of it. But... I can't believe it's really..."
#Main Character
"I thought it was a fifty-fifty chance whether you'd come here or go to Maya-san's room, but if your ultimate goal was Maya-san, I figured you'd come here first."
She didn't answer.
Eventually, Dr. Mikanagi and the others arrived.
#Tsujimura
"—Hiyama-san... is that you...?"
Seeing her figure, Tsujimura-san let the words slip.
#Main Character
"No. Isn't that right—Souko-san?"
#Souko
"...Yes, that's right."
Souko-san spoke, having cast aside her mask.
#Tsujimura
"So it was... Kirihara-sama..."
#Souko
"...Did you know it was me from the very beginning?"
#Main Character
"...The cup in Shion-san's room, you'd put cola in it, hadn't you, Souko-san? It was right before the kitchen exploded."
#Souko
"I washed it thoroughly, you know?"
#Main Character
"Even if you washed it, the fact that it was in your room doesn't disappear. All the other identical cups were shattered in the blast."
#Souko
"...I see. That might have been a bit of a blunder."
#Benio
"Why did you kill Shion?"
#Souko
"—Because she was the culprit."
#Benio
"Don't screw with me!"
Benio-san lunged at Souko-san, grabbing her.
#Benio
"You were the one who did everything, weren't you!?"
#Souko
"I had no reason to kill Rokuyou-san."
#Benio
"But still!!"
#Souko
"It's a fact. Shion-san was the one who killed Rokuyou-san. If you doubt it, I'll show you clear evidence."
#Benio
"Shut up...!"
#Main Character
"Souko-san... when did you realize it?"
#Souko
"Let's see... perhaps right after Rokuyou-san's body was discovered. The chapel was unlocked."
#Benio
"Then why—"
#Souko
"To move my own plan forward."
Souko-san gave a thin smile.
#Main Character
"—No, there's a high probability that Shion-san only killed Rokuyou-san."
#Souko
"Oh, so you noticed."
#Main Character
"...Only thanks to you, Souko-san. But... you knew from the beginning, didn't you?"
#Souko
"Yes, I did."
#Main Character
"And yet... you said nothing just to keep your own plan moving."
#Souko
"Bullseye."
Souko-san gave a thin smile.
#Main Character
"Revenge... but why—"
#Souko
"Are you really asking that now? I thought you understood."
#Benio
"...Because your mother was murdered?"
#Souko
"...The burn on my back, it throbs. The place where that woman scorched me."
Souko-san glared at Maya-san, who was standing in the doorway.
#Maya
"No way..."
#Souko
"I have almost no memories left from back then. ...But even so, yours is the one face I remember clearly."
#Takamine
"Could it be... you were also... Marino-san's daughter...?"
#Tsujimura
"Kanon-ojousama...?"
#Souko
"Kanon...?"
Souko-san tilted her head slightly.
#Takamine
"...The child rescued along with Marino-san back then was taken to the city hospital with severe burns. That was Kanon."
#Souko
"...So it seems. Apparently that's my name—Takamine-san, you just said 'also.' Don't tell me—"
#Takamine
"...The one rescued along with you was Shion-kun, whom you killed."
#Souko
"...I see, so it really was—"
#Main Character
"...If you knew that, you didn't have to kill her...!"
#Souko
"I couldn't stop! ...I really shouldn't have brought you along."
#Benio
"...Your plan was in motion even before Shion killed Rokuyou, wasn't it? Coming here was part of the plan all along."
#Souko
"...I really should have made sure to kill you."
#Benio
"Sorry, but I don't intend to die just yet. ...Though I feel bad for my sister."
#Main Character
"Why did you leave Ai-san in such a half-finished state when you killed her...?"
#Souko
"That was... because you arrived too early. I intended to finish cleaning up later."
#Main Character
"...The reason Ai-san's head was missing was because you wanted us to think Shion-san's crime was still ongoing."
#Souko
"That would be it."
#Benio
"Why did you kill Akane?"
#Main Character
"That's likely because... I was with Benio-san at the time, right?"
#Souko
"...That too, but she saw me. When I was in the clinic in the middle of the night."
#Mikanagi
"I see... that's when you tampered with Shion-san's medicine."
#Souko
"Exactly."
#Main Character
"That was while we were locked in the basement."
#Souko
"Yes. I'd already made preparations by making the kitchen unusable."
#Main Character
"...And that's how you swapped them."
#Souko
"I did a little work to make it look like me."
Souko-san moved her bandaged finger.
#Souko
"I don't think it's broken. Your diagnosis was wrong."
#Mikanagi
"Well, thank you—my apologies."
Dr. Mikanagi answered with a stiff voice.
#Souko
"She seemed to be sniffing around for something as well. Isn't that right?"
Souko-san looked toward Maya-san again.
#Maya
"............"
#Main Character
"Right now, Souko-san... we're here to examine your crimes."
#Souko
"Right. Don't get sidetracked."
Souko-san said gently.
#Main Character
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"You still have more you want to say, don't you?"
#Main Character
"No..."
#Souko
"—I see. Finished? Then—"
Souko-san moved.
In an instant, she snatched the knife from the floor, dashed across the room, and pinned herself behind Maya-san.
#Main Character
"Souko-san!?"
#Souko
"Don't move."
Souko-san pressed the tip of the blade against Maya-san's neck.
#Maya
"Hih...!"
#Benio
"Mother!"
#Souko
"Benio-san, my mother was killed just like this."
#Main Character
"Stop it, Souko-san!"
#Souko
"I told you not to move, didn't I?"
I couldn't move once I saw the blade biting into Maya-san's neck.
#Souko
"That's better."
Souko-san moved slowly, stepping out into the corridor.
#Benio
"There's nowhere for you to run."
#Souko
"I won't tell you not to follow, but stay back. Otherwise—"
She gently pulled the knife.
#Maya
"Ah, aaah..."
#Souko
"...I want this woman to taste even more despair."
#Main Character
"...Could everyone please move to the performance room?"
#Souko
"The performance room...?"
#Main Character
"...Earlier, I found Kousei-san's sheet music in the basement. Unfortunately, I can't play any instruments, so I'd like Benio-san to play it..."
#Benio
"I don't mind, but..."
#Main Character
"Then let's go. ...Souko-san."
#Souko
"I won't run away now... there's nowhere to go anyway... and I'm curious to hear what you have to say."
#Main Character
"...I see."
We left the room, surrounding Souko-san.
