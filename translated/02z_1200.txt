I've returned to my room.
＃Souko
「Things turned out quite horribly, didn't they……」
Souko-san, who returned with me, murmured.
＃Protagonist
「They really did…… what should we do now?」
＃Souko
「Assuming help arrives in two days…… the police will come, and Shion-san will be arrested, I suppose. That'll make it difficult to research the local legends around here.」
＃Protagonist
「Are we going home?」
＃Souko
「……Yeah. It seems best to just stay quiet.」
Saying so, Souko-san took out a bottle of Coke.
＃Souko
「I wonder if this will last another two days…… I'll have to drink it sparingly.」
＃Protagonist
「But…… there are still things that aren't clear. The motive, for one, and the whereabouts of Rokuyou-san's head, the phone line, even the suspension bridge??」
＃Souko
「Let's leave all that to the police when they arrive. Since she confessed, they'll find a way to tie it all together, even if they have to force it.」
＃Protagonist
「But??」
Somehow, it didn't sit right with me.
I should have solved the case??so what was this nagging feeling?
The culprit had been found.
But…… I felt as though everything else had been buried away in the darkness.
