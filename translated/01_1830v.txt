We passed through the door and returned to the entrance hall from earlier.
＃Benio
"This is the main hall and entrance. These stairs are the only way to reach the second floor."
＃Protagonist
"It really is spacious..."
I let out my honest impression of the place.
＃Benio
"I feel the same way, even living here. Just cleaning my own room is quite a chore."
With that, Benio-san opened the door on the opposite side of the one we had just come through—the right side when facing the entrance.
＃Benio
"Over here we have the servants' quarters and the dining room. The two on the right are the servants' rooms, while on the left, the first door is the restroom, the one behind it is the kitchen, and at the end is the grand dining hall."
Benio-san explained each room as we walked along.
＃Benio
"We have two servants on staff, so please don't hesitate to ask if you need anything."
＃Protagonist
"O-oh, alright..."
I’ve never lived a life with servants before, so I wasn't quite sure how to handle that.
Just then, a small black mass came tumbling down the hallway toward us.
＃Protagonist
"Wait, is that a cat...?"
It was a black cat.
Its eyes were two different colors.
It seemed to be carrying something in its mouth.
＃Benio
"Ah, Love!"
Benio-san cried out.
＃???
"Hey, wait! Aiko!"
A woman came rushing out from the kitchen entrance.
＃Benio
"Ah... Akane-san?"
＃???
"Benio-ojousama, please catch Aiko! She swiped the dried sardines I was going to use for the broth again!"
＃Benio
"I keep telling you her name is Love... honestly."
Just as Benio-san muttered that and started to crouch down...
The woman called Akane-san tripped on the carpet and stumbled.
＃???
"Hya, waah!?"
＃Protagonist
"Look out!"
[Help the woman]
[Protect Benio-san]
I instinctively reached out and caught the woman as she was about to fall.
＃???
"Kyah!"
＃Protagonist
"A-are you alright?"
I managed to support her as we tumbled together...
＃???
"Eh... A-ah... thank... you very much."
The woman addressed as Akane-san murmured in a small voice, her face turning bright red.
I instinctively threw myself over Benio-san, who was crouching on the floor.
＃Benio
"Kyah!?"
＃???
"Kyah!"
The woman crashed into my back.
The impact pushed my body against Benio-san...
＃Benio
"You're in the way!"
She shoved me off with surprising force.
＃Souko
"...What on earth are you doing?"
Souko-san offered me a hand with a look of sheer disbelief on her face.
＃Protagonist
"N-no... I was just trying to help."
＃Souko
"...I know you like girls, but really."
＃Protagonist
"T-That's a misunderstanding!"
＃Souko
"So, you hate them then?"
＃Protagonist
"How did you even reach that conclusion..."
＃Benio
"Akane-san, please watch your step."
Benio-san let out an exasperated sigh.
＃???
"U-um, I'm so sorry..."
＃Benio
"It's just a few sardines, isn't it? Love gets hungry too, after all."
＃???
"But still..."
＃Benio
"And besides, you seem to have something on the corner of your mouth."
＃???
"Eh...!?"
There was indeed something that looked like whipped cream on her lip.
＃???
"U-um, this is just... I was only doing a little taste-testing."
＃Benio
"I thought the cooking was Narumi-san's job?"
＃???
"W-well, yes, it is, but..."
While the woman continued to offer her fumbling excuses, Benio-san turned to us and bowed.
＃Benio
"I'm terribly sorry. Our servant can be a bit clumsy. Akane-san, introduce yourself."
＃???
"Um, I'm very sorry. My name is Akane Hiyama, and I serve as a maid for this house."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, I'm (NAME01) (NAME02)."
＃Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara. Nice to meet you."
＃Akane
"U-um, I'm truly sorry for what happened!"
She bowed so deeply that it made me feel a bit awkward.
＃Protagonist
"No, really, don't worry about it."
＃Souko
"You certainly got a nice bonus out of it, didn't you?"
＃Protagonist
"It wasn't like that at all."
＃???
"What's all the racket?"
Another woman poked her head out from the kitchen.
＃Akane
"I-it's nothing, Narumi-san!"
Akane-san rushed over to the woman.
＃Benio
"Narumi-san, these people are our new guests."
＃???
"Oh."
＃Protagonist
"Um, my name is (NAME01) (NAME02)."
＃Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara."
＃???
"I'm Narumi Minakami. Nice to meet ya."
After the introductions were finished, Benio-san spoke to Narumi-san.
＃Benio
"Now then, please prepare some extra food for dinner."
＃Narumi
"Eeeh? Starting now?"
Narumi-san let out a blatantly annoyed groan.
＃Benio
"Of course. We can hardly fail to serve our guests a proper meal."
＃Narumi
"Well, yeah, I guess... but it's such a pain."
...I wondered if it was really okay to say something like that to your employer.
＃Benio
"I'm counting on you."
...Since Benio-san didn't seem to mind, I suppose this was a common occurrence here.
＃Narumi
"Fine, fine. So, is there anything you guests can't eat?"
＃Souko
"Nothing in particular for me."
＃Protagonist
"I..."
[Nothing in particular]
[I can't stand baran]
＃Protagonist
"I don't have any specific dislikes."
＃Narumi
"Got it. Then maybe some shaved ice would be fine? We can just use the snow from outside."
Narumi-san said something outrageous with a straight face.
＃Akane
"Narumi-san!"
＃Narumi
"I'm just kidding."
＃Protagonist
"I just can't stand baran, no matter what."
＃Narumi
"Oh? Then I'll make sure to put plenty in for you. ...Wait, what's baran again?"
＃Protagonist
"It's those plastic leaves they use as decoration for sushi."
＃Narumi
"Ah, right. ...Wait, that's not even food, is it!?"
＃Protagonist
"That's why I said I can't eat it."
＃Narumi
"Ugh, you're kind of annoying..."
＃Akane
"Narumi-san, please calm down."
＃Souko
"Honestly, this isn't the time or place for teasing people."
Souko-san gave my head a playful nudge.
＃Benio
"Narumi-san prepares all the meals for this household."
＃Protagonist
"Oh, so she's not a professional chef?"
＃Narumi
"Nothing fancy like that. I'm just doing it because I don't have any other useful skills."
＃Benio
"You should follow Akane-san's example and learn how to handle other chores as well."
＃Narumi
"Suuure."
...That was an incredibly half-hearted response.
