#Souko
"Let's leave it at that for now."
It turned two o'clock, and Souko-san wrapped things up.
#Satoshi
"...Did you find anything out?"
#Souko
"Asking that is my job, you know."
Souko-san said with a wry smile.
#Souko
"But well... if I were to give my own impression, there wasn't anything that would serve as decisive evidence."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Souko
"A time-delayed murder using the gears of the clock—nobody turned up who had an alibi for the time the mechanism was likely set. Including you and me."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"As a summary for this stage, it'll be difficult to find the culprit. So, let's start thinking about the motive."
#Satoshi
"The motive... huh. The reason for killing Rokuyou-san and Ai-san..."
#Benio
"—It's about the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"Whoa!?"
Benio-san suddenly cut in from behind me.
#Benio
"Well, that would make me the most suspicious person, though."
Benio-san chuckled.
#Souko
"...Do you want the inheritance?"
#Benio
"Didn't I say this morning that I wasn't interested?"
Benio-san continued.
#Benio
"Well, even if I'm not interested, if I'm eligible, the inheritance will come to me."
#Souko
"...It seems best to keep in mind that this might be an incident related to the inheritance."
#Satoshi
"But if that's the case—"
I looked at Benio-san.
#Benio
"What is it?"
#Satoshi
"...I think the probability of you being the next victim increases, Benio-san."
#Souko
"You're right... or perhaps Shion-san."
#Benio
"Hmm... that's not a very pleasant thought."
Benio-san crossed her arms.
#Satoshi
"Please be extremely careful, Benio-san."
#Benio
"I know."
#Souko
"By the way, who do you think is the culprit so far?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... me...?"
#Souko
"Of course, you can't tell anyone else right now. I don't want to breed unnecessary suspicion. But... I want to confirm it."
#Benio
"Hmm... true enough. Let's hear your brilliant reasoning. I don't mind if you point to me as the culprit."
#Satoshi
"Umm... well..."
#Souko
"Me? Why?"
#Satoshi
"Please don't get angry, okay?"
#Souko
"It's your opinion, so I won't get mad, but..."
#Satoshi
"It's simply because you don't have an alibi..."
#Souko
"Maya-san, huh... I wonder."
#Benio
"...If it's about the inheritance, it's not unthinkable. If the number of heirs decreases, the share coming to oneself increases."
#Satoshi
"...Though it doesn't feel very realistic."
#Souko
"...Ai-san is dead, isn't she?"
#Satoshi
"...I'm just saying that suicide is a possibility. If you catch the rope in the gears and put your neck through while it's loose..."
#Benio
"...I see. It's not an impossible scenario... but what would be the cause of the suicide?"
#Satoshi
"Perhaps... it's because Rokuyou-san died?"
#Souko
"That would be convincing, but it's too hasty to jump to that conclusion."
#Benio
"...Agreed."
#Satoshi
"You're right... it would be dangerous to discard the possibility of homicide."
#Benio
"No fool would call that situation a suicide."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Benio
"...Hmm, you're certainly right. If we consider the inheritance, the motive isn't entirely absent."
#Satoshi
"I'm just stating possibilities, so please don't be angry."
#Benio
"I'm not angry."
#Satoshi
"You clearly are..."
#Souko
"Shion-san, huh... they seemed to be on good terms, but I wonder..."
#Benio
"There's no evidence... but there might be a motive, just as there is for me."
#Satoshi
"That's true..."
#Benio
"Tsujimura, huh... it wouldn't be impossible, but..."
#Souko
"Since he's Mr. Kousei's brother, there's a possibility he could inherit, but... I doubt that man would think of something like this."
#Benio
"I agree with that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Souko
"...Look, Rokuyou-san is already dead."
#Benio
"Are you trying to say he's come back from the grave?"
#Satoshi
"No, I'm just saying it's a possibility."
#Souko
"If that body isn't Rokuyou-san, then who on earth is it?"
#Satoshi
"Well... sorry, I was wrong."
#Benio
"Pull yourself together..."
#Benio
"Takamine is the culprit... he did say he was confined to his room the whole time, but..."
#Souko
"But there's no evidence. ...Seriously, I'm glad he isn't here right now."
#Benio
"Truly. He'd have punched you if he'd heard that."
#Satoshi
"You're probably right..."
#Benio
"...If the Doctor were the culprit, it'd be tough. I wouldn't be able to believe in anything."
#Souko
"...You're right. Forget about the autopsy, we wouldn't even be able to take medicine if we felt unwell."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Wasn't Akane-san with you?"
#Satoshi
"...Can't we consider that that might have been the excuse for creating an alibi?"
#Souko
"You're free to think that, but... if that were the case, I don't think she would have guided you to where Ai-san was."
#Benio
"Perhaps she was trying to incite a sense of urgency at the very last second... but it's difficult."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"Akane-san, huh... based on her usual behavior, it's hard to think so..."
#Satoshi
"...But I think it's dangerous to easily remove her from the suspects."
#Benio
"...Perhaps. Though, I think it's also a problem to suspect someone without any confirmation."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Benio
"If Narumi were the culprit, it'd be terrifying. We'd hardly be able to eat."
#Souko
"That's true... so you won't be eating the food Narumi-san made?"
#Satoshi
"Eh... why does it come to that?"
#Benio
"There's a possibility it's been poisoned, isn't there? If you really hate it, you'll just have to cook for yourself."
#Satoshi
"That'd be tough..."
#Souko
"As long as the culprit isn't identified, the only measure we have is to defend ourselves."
#Satoshi
"...You're right."
