I've returned to the dining hall.
#Akane
"Oh, what's the matter?"
Akane-san was tidying up the table.
Maybe because there were so many people, it doesn't look like much progress has been made yet.
Help
Don't help
#Satoshi
"Shall I help you?"
I made the offer.
#Akane
"E-Eh, no, that's quite alright! I couldn't possibly let a guest do such a thing!"
Akane-san shook her head in a panic.
#Satoshi
"But wouldn't it be faster with two people tidying up?"
#Akane
"But... um, I'll gratefully accept just the thought alone."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Um, do you need anything else?"
#Satoshi
"Anything else, huh..."
#Satoshi
"I'm sorry, you seem to be in the middle of work."
I shouldn't get in the way of her tidying up.
I gave a bow and left the dining hall.
I've come to the dining hall again.
#Akane
"Is something wrong?"
Akane-san was mopping the floor.
The tidying up seems to be mostly finished.
#Satoshi
"Uh..."
I've come to the dining hall.
#Satoshi
"Huh... no one's here."
The room was empty.
All the food from earlier has been cleared away.
No one's here, so what should I do now...
