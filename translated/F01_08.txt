I've returned to the dining hall.
＃Akane
「Oh, what's the matter?」
Akane-san was tidying up the table.
Maybe because there were so many people, it doesn't look like much progress has been made yet.
Help
Don't help
＃Protagonist
「Shall I help you?」
I made the offer.
＃Akane
「E-Eh, no, that's quite alright! I couldn't possibly let a guest do such a thing!」
Akane-san shook her head in a panic.
＃Protagonist
「But wouldn't it be faster with two people tidying up?」
＃Akane
「But... um, I'll gratefully accept just the thought alone.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「Um, do you need anything else?」
＃Protagonist
「Anything else, huh...」
＃Protagonist
「I'm sorry, you seem to be in the middle of work.」
I shouldn't get in the way of her tidying up.
I gave a bow and left the dining hall.
I've come to the dining hall again.
＃Akane
「Is something wrong?」
Akane-san was mopping the floor.
The tidying up seems to be mostly finished.
＃Protagonist
「Uh...」
I've come to the dining hall.
＃Protagonist
「Huh... no one's here.」
The room was empty.
All the food from earlier has been cleared away.
No one's here, so what should I do now...
