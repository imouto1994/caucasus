"The possibility of Shion-san being the killer... I can't say it's zero."
#Satoshi
"...True."
#Maya
"Shion was inside the chapel all night. Although, I doubt there is anyone who can confirm that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Are you suggesting Shion killed Isamu-san!? That child couldn't possibly do such a thing!"
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Benio
"Shion being forced into an unwanted marriage and killing Rokuyou... it's not entirely out of the question..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"I was... sleeping inside the coffin. I did not step outside."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"The idea of Lady Shion killing Master Rokuyou... it is unthinkable."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"The lid of the coffin used in the ritual has hinges, but it's far too heavy for someone with Shion-kun's strength to open."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"...Shion-san might not have been enthusiastic about the marriage to Isamu. Her own will wasn't exactly being respected, after all..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"I believe Lady Shion was in the coffin the entire time."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Now that you mention it, I've never seen Lady Shion and Rokuyou-san talking. Of course, they must have spoken when I wasn't around."
#Satoshi
"True..."
