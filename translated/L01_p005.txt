「The possibility of Shion-san being the killer... I can't say it's zero.」
＃Protagonist
「...True.」
＃Maya
「Shion was inside the chapel all night. Although, I doubt there is anyone who can confirm that.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Ai
「Are you suggesting Shion killed Isamu-san!? That child couldn't possibly do such a thing!」
＃Protagonist
「Y-You're right...」
＃Benio
「Shion being forced into an unwanted marriage and killing Rokuyou... it's not entirely out of the question...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Shion
「I was... sleeping inside the coffin. I did not step outside.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「The idea of Lady Shion killing Master Rokuyou... it is unthinkable.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「The lid of the coffin used in the ritual has hinges, but it's far too heavy for someone with Shion-kun's strength to open.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「...Shion-san might not have been enthusiastic about the marriage to Isamu. Her own will wasn't exactly being respected, after all...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「I believe Lady Shion was in the coffin the entire time.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「Now that you mention it, I've never seen Lady Shion and Rokuyou-san talking. Of course, they must have spoken when I wasn't around.」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
