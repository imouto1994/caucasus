"Hello, Dr. Mikanagi."
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
"Oh, hello."
＃Protagonist
"Do you have a moment?"
＃Mikanagi
"Yes, I don't mind."
Now, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
"Excuse me."
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
"Oh, what is it this time?"
＃Protagonist
"Do you have a moment?"
＃Mikanagi
"Yes, go ahead."
Now, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi was nowhere to be found.
I wonder if he's gone somewhere else.
Now, what should I do?
＃Protagonist
"Dr. Mikanagi, are you in?"
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
"Oh, hello. Is something the matter?"
＃Akane
"Dr. Mikanagi, have you seen Lady Ai?"
＃Mikanagi
"Ai-san? ...No, she hasn't come here."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"Please let us know if you see her."
＃Mikanagi
"Yes, understood."
We decided to head elsewhere.
＃Protagonist
"Dr. Mikanagi, are you in?"
As I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
"Have you still not found Ai-san?"
＃Akane
"No... that's right."
＃Mikanagi
"I wonder what happened... I'm starting to get worried."
＃Protagonist
"Well, we're going to keep looking around other areas."
＃Mikanagi
"Right, I'm counting on you."
We left the infirmary.
＃Protagonist
"Excuse me."
When I entered the infirmary, Dr. Mikanagi was nowhere to be found.
I wonder if he's gone somewhere else.
＃Akane
"It seems Lady Ai isn't here."
Indeed, she was nowhere to be seen.
＃Protagonist
"Let's head somewhere else."
We left the infirmary.
