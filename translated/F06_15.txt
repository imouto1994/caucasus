「It's you... what do you want?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, could I talk to you for a moment?」

「Y-Yes...」
＃Takamine
「So, what's your business?」
＃Protagonist
「Um...」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.
I wonder if he's in... feeling a bit nervous, I knock on the door.
＃Takamine

＃Takamine
「Fine, I suppose.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yes...」
＃Takamine
「What is it this time?」
I’ve reached the front of Takamine-san's room.

＃Protagonist
「Takamine-san, it's me.」
However, no matter how long I waited, there was no response from inside.
Is he out?
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
