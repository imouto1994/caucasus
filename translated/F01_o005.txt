「Huh... there's even something like that.」
＃Souko
「So it was Shion-san's room... She's the only one made to live in the annex.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Maya
「There is indeed a tower outside... is something wrong?」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, no, it's nothing.」
＃Maya
「That is the room of my youngest daughter, Shion. Her constitution is weak, so we have her living in the annex.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Ai
「Yes, there is a tower...」
＃Ai
「...That is indeed Shion's room. Since she is physically weak, she has always lived there.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Benio
「If you wish to go there, I believe you should speak to Tsujimura in the office.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Benio
「With this much snow, it would be impossible to reach the tower from anywhere but the office door.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right.」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes, you can reach the tower in the back from the office, but...」
＃Protagonist
「Would it be alright if I went there?」
＃Tsujimura
「I'm sorry, but that's a bit...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
It seems it's no use without a proper reason.
＃Tsujimura
「In this snow, I'll have to do some shoveling myself. It would be a disaster if Lady Shion were to trip.」
＃Protagonist
「That's true.」
＃Rokuyou
「The tower where Shion is, right? There's a gatekeeper there, so you can't just approach it carelessly.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「The tower outside... if you want to see it, you should ask Mr. Tsujimura.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「...I hear Shion-kun has lived in that tower since a long time ago.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Mikanagi
「The tower... you can get there through the back door in the office.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「I've heard Shion-san lives in the annex because she's physically weak... but it might have been my father who gave those instructions...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「The tower outside? That is Lady Shion's room...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Akane
「I am the one who brings Lady Shion her meals, but she usually eats them in the office.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Narumi
「The youngest daughter, Lady Shion, lives in that tower outside.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Narumi
「Only Lady Shion lives in the annex... it's a bit strange, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「I suppose so...」
