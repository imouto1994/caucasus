"Huh... there's even something like that."
#Souko
"So it was Shion-san's room... She's the only one made to live in the annex."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Maya
"There is indeed a tower outside... is something wrong?"
#Satoshi
"Oh, no, it's nothing."
#Maya
"That is the room of my youngest daughter, Shion. Her constitution is weak, so we have her living in the annex."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"Yes, there is a tower..."
#Ai
"...That is indeed Shion's room. Since she is physically weak, she has always lived there."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"If you wish to go there, I believe you should speak to Tsujimura in the office."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"With this much snow, it would be impossible to reach the tower from anywhere but the office door."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
#Tsujimura
"Yes, you can reach the tower in the back from the office, but..."
#Satoshi
"Would it be alright if I went there?"
#Tsujimura
"I'm sorry, but that's a bit..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
It seems it's no use without a proper reason.
#Tsujimura
"In this snow, I'll have to do some shoveling myself. It would be a disaster if Lady Shion were to trip."
#Satoshi
"That's true."
#Rokuyou
"The tower where Shion is, right? There's a gatekeeper there, so you can't just approach it carelessly."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"The tower outside... if you want to see it, you should ask Mr. Tsujimura."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Takamine
"...I hear Shion-kun has lived in that tower since a long time ago."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Mikanagi
"The tower... you can get there through the back door in the office."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"I've heard Shion-san lives in the annex because she's physically weak... but it might have been my father who gave those instructions..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"The tower outside? That is Lady Shion's room..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Akane
"I am the one who brings Lady Shion her meals, but she usually eats them in the office."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Narumi
"The youngest daughter, Lady Shion, lives in that tower outside."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Narumi
"Only Lady Shion lives in the annex... it's a bit strange, isn't it?"
#Satoshi
"I suppose so..."
