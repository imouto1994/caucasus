Morning came.
I woke up and checked the clock; it was 7:00 AM.
In the end, I had spent the night without a wink of sleep.
What should I do today...
I guess I'll get up and see how everyone is doing...
As I came down the stairs, I ran into Tsujimura-san coming out of the western corridor on the first floor.
...I woke up.
Looking at the clock, it was 7:00 AM.
As I tried to sit up, every joint in my body ached.
I guess it's because I was sitting up huddled in a blanket...
As I tried to stand, I noticed Shion-san was gone.
No way... again...!?
I dashed down the stairs.
If she was wandering around like she did last night—
＃Shion
「Kyaa!?」
＃Protagonist
「Whoa—!?」
I nearly collided with her at the bottom of the stairs and screeched to a halt.
＃Protagonist
「Sh-Shion-san!?」
＃Shion
「A-Ah, g-good morning...」
Shion-san bowed, looking a bit frightened.
＃Protagonist
「Ah... good morning, Shion-san. Where were—」
As I asked, I noticed her hair was damp.
＃Shion
「Um... I was taking a bath...」
Shion-san answered, her face flushing red.
＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
Embarrassed, I looked away as well.
＃Protagonist
「Anyway, I'm glad nothing happened.」
＃Shion
「Yes... thank you very much.」
Shion-san bowed.
Truthfully, I wanted to ask her about last night... but since she didn't say anything, I felt hesitant to bring it up.
Maybe I'll consult with Dr. Mikanagi later...
＃Protagonist
「Well then, I'll be going now. See you later.」
＃Shion
「Yes... goodbye.」
I went outside.
Snow was still falling, but it wasn't a violent blizzard.
Hunching my shoulders against the cold, I headed for the office door.
＃Protagonist
「Hmm...?」
I found something glittering at my feet.
＃Protagonist
「This is...」
Half-buried in the snow was an earring.
I wonder whose it is... I'll hold onto it for now.
Returning to the mansion, I met Tsujimura-san as I reached the hall.
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san, good morning.」
＃Tsujimura
「Good morning. ...Um, has Benio-ojousama woken up yet?」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san...? No, I haven't seen her this morning.」
Is she still asleep?
＃Protagonist
「I'll go take a look.」
＃Tsujimura
「Eh... but... I can't let a guest do such a thing...」
＃Protagonist
「Given the situation, let's not worry about being a guest. I'll go check.」
Leaving Tsujimura-san there, I climbed the stairs.
To the western corridor on the second floor.
I thought it would be fine, but a sliver of anxiety remained.
Please, let Benio-san be safe—
I knocked on the door.
There was no response.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, please wake up.」
I knocked several times, but still no response.
Could it be...
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, Benio-san, come on!」
I turned the doorknob.
The door opened with almost disappointing ease.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san!」
I burst into the room.
She wasn't there.
Benio-san, who had been such a heavy sleeper yesterday, was nowhere to be found.
The bed was neatly made.
It didn't look like she'd just woken up.
＃Protagonist
「Love...?」
The black cat emerged from the bathroom.
No way...
I hurriedly peered into the bathroom, but Benio-san wasn't there.
The black cat was scratching at the closed door.
＃Protagonist
「Outside...?」
When I opened the door, the cat ran out into the corridor.
The cat was calling to me from down the hall.
I had no choice but to follow.
I wonder how far it's going.
The cat walked toward the eastern side, past the atrium.
Souko-san's room and the performance room are over there...
As I entered the eastern corridor, Souko-san happened to be coming out of her room.
＃Souko
「Oh, morning.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Souko-san. Did a black cat just come this way?」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Souko-san. Did Lovecraft just come this way?」
＃Souko
「If you mean Love-chan, she ran toward the performance room... what's wrong?」
Souko-san tilted her head.
＃Protagonist
「...I can't find Benio-san.」
＃Souko
「Eh... she's not in her room?」
＃Protagonist
「No... I followed the cat here...」
＃Protagonist
「No... I followed Lovecraft here...」
Souko-san and I looked at the door at the very end of the corridor almost simultaneously.
＃Souko
「...It's open.」
The door was slightly ajar.
The black cat must have slipped inside through that gap.
Souko-san walked toward the end of the hall.
I had a bad premonition.
No—I had nothing *but* a bad premonition.
＃Protagonist
「...Souko-san, did you notice anything during the night...?」
＃Souko
「...Nothing in particular. I might have been asleep, though...」
Souko-san placed her hand on the door.
As soon as we entered—I noticed it.
＃Protagonist
「You've... got to be kidding...?」
The grand piano in the center.
The figure of Benio-san slumped face-down upon it.
But—once again, the head was missing.
＃Souko
「Why...?」
Souko-san let the words slip.
Truly—why?
For Benio-san to be turned into such a state.
I simply stared blankly at Benio-san's headless corpse.
＃Souko
「...I have to go tell the others.」
Souko-san turned on her heel and left the performance room.
I couldn't move.
The black cat rubbed against me.
＃Protagonist
「...I'm sorry, Benio-san. I couldn't protect you...」
I picked up the cat and left the room, following after Souko-san.
