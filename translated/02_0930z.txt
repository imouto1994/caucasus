I think I’ve seen enough.
＃Protagonist
"I think this is sufficient."
I addressed Souko-san.
＃Souko
"If you’re satisfied, then I suppose it is."
＃Protagonist
"It makes me a little uneasy when you put it like that..."
[Keep investigating]
[I’ve seen enough]
Maybe I should look a bit more.
I might have overlooked something.
I think I’ve searched every corner.
＃Protagonist
"I think I’m okay now."
＃Souko
"In that case, let’s head back to the Great Hall and see what we can learn from the others."
＃Protagonist
"Right. ...What should we do about this room?"
＃Mikanagi
"We should probably lock it and keep it sealed. We’ve already disturbed it, but the police will be here eventually."
＃Protagonist
"Understood."
We stepped into the hallway and I locked the door.
＃Protagonist
"I should probably leave the key with Tsujimura-san, right?"
＃Mikanagi
"Yes, that would be best."
＃Souko
"Alright, let’s head back."
