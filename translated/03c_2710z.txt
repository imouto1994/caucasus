I wonder if this is enough.

That's enough
I'll search a little more, as I might have missed something.
This should be enough.
#Main Character
"...In the end, we still don't know if it was suicide or murder."
#Benio
"No—"
Benio-san grabbed my arm.
#Main Character
"Eh?"
#Benio
"Clear proof that it was murder has come to light. This cup—it’s one from the kitchen."
Benio-san used a handkerchief to pick up the cup that had been rolling on the floor.
She likely drank the poison from it, but...
#Main Character
"Eh... True, if the cup shouldn't be here, the possibility of murder arises... but if Shion-san was the one who brought it—"
#Benio
"When could Shion have taken it? The kitchen was trashed long ago."
#Main Character
"That... maybe before that..."
#Benio
"Shion never brought anything to her room on her own. Besides—the kitchen shelves are too high for Shion to reach."
Was... that true...?
#Benio
"You should ask Narumi."
#Main Character
"But... then who..."
#Benio
"Didn't you see someone using a cup exactly like this one before?"
#Main Character
"Even if you say that... there are plenty of cups, aren't they?"
#Benio
"The time the kitchen exploded... just before noon. Narumi should have washed and put away everything used by breakfast."
#Main Character
"But... ah."
Now that she mentions it—I feel like I saw this cup somewhere...
But—
#Benio
"...So you remember it."
#Main Character
"B-But... no way—"
#Benio
"Of course, I can't say for certain yet. I don't know the motive either—no, maybe the reason is that...?"
Benio-san pointed at Kousei-san's journal, which I was holding.
#Main Character
"This...?"
#Benio
"It's too early to jump to conclusions, but... shall we set a trap?"
#Main Character
"A trap...?"
#Benio
"Yes. —Doctor, sorry to ask, but please gather everyone in the main hall. First, we'll tell everyone that Shion has committed suicide."
#Main Character
"U-Understood."
#Benio
"Follow my lead."
After pulling the covers over Shion-san's remains, we returned to the office to discuss the plan.
