I've come to the dining hall.
＃Protagonist
"Huh..."
Nobody's here.
I thought someone would usually be in the dining hall.
What should I do...
I've come to the dining hall.
＃Narumi
"Ah, what's up?"
Narumi-san spoke to me.
＃Protagonist
"I'm just doing some rounds for now."
＃Narumi
"I see. Thanks for all the trouble."
＃Protagonist
"No, I'm just doing it on my own accord."
＃Narumi
"You're quite dedicated..."
Narumi-san let out a voice that sounded halfway between impressed and exasperated.
I've come to the dining hall.
＃Narumi
"Oh, what's wrong this time?"
Narumi-san noticed me and spoke up.
＃Protagonist
"Uh, well..."
I've come to the dining hall.
＃Narumi
"Ah, what's up?"
Narumi-san, who was sitting listlessly in a chair, spoke to me.
＃Protagonist
"I'm doing rounds. We still don't know what might happen."
＃Narumi
"Ah... right. Thanks for the effort."
＃Protagonist
"No... I'm just doing it on my own accord."
Despite checking around this much, I still haven't found Akane-san—
＃Narumi
"Ah!?"
Narumi-san suddenly let out a startled cry.
＃Protagonist
"Wh-What is it!?"
I look in the direction Narumi-san is staring, but I can only see the corridor through the dining hall door.
＃Narumi
"Just now... Akane was..."
＃Protagonist
"What!?"
I step out into the corridor with Narumi-san.
There's no sign of Akane-san anywhere.
＃Protagonist
"Do you know what she was doing?"
＃Narumi
"She came out of Akane's room... and seemed to head for the hall..."
While saying that, Narumi-san puts her hand on the door to Akane-san's room.
＃Narumi
"It's locked... That's strange..."
I try twisting the doorknob too, but it seems to be locked after all.
＃Protagonist
"Are you sure you didn't misidentify her?"
＃Narumi
"Hmm... I only saw her from behind, so..."
＃Protagonist
"...I'll go look for her."
It's better to take action than to stand here worrying.
＃Narumi
"Ah, yeah. ...Be careful, you never know what might happen."
＃Protagonist
"...Yeah."
I parted ways with Narumi-san.
If Akane-san really was there, what on earth is she doing...?
When I entered the dining hall, Narumi-san approached me with a worried expression.
＃Narumi
"Did you find Akane?"
＃Protagonist
"No... I couldn't find her."
I shake my head.
＃Narumi
"I see..."
＃Protagonist
"Um, I'll try looking a little more."
I turn on my heel and head back out into the corridor.
