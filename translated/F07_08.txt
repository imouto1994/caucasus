I've come to the dining hall.
#Satoshi
"Huh..."
Nobody's here.
I thought someone would usually be in the dining hall.
What should I do...
I've come to the dining hall.
#Narumi
"Ah, what's up?"
Narumi-san spoke to me.
#Satoshi
"I'm just doing some rounds for now."
#Narumi
"I see. Thanks for all the trouble."
#Satoshi
"No, I'm just doing it on my own accord."
#Narumi
"You're quite dedicated..."
Narumi-san let out a voice that sounded halfway between impressed and exasperated.
I've come to the dining hall.
#Narumi
"Oh, what's wrong this time?"
Narumi-san noticed me and spoke up.
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to the dining hall.
#Narumi
"Ah, what's up?"
Narumi-san, who was sitting listlessly in a chair, spoke to me.
#Satoshi
"I'm doing rounds. We still don't know what might happen."
#Narumi
"Ah... right. Thanks for the effort."
#Satoshi
"No... I'm just doing it on my own accord."
Despite checking around this much, I still haven't found Akane-san—
#Narumi
"Ah!?"
Narumi-san suddenly let out a startled cry.
#Satoshi
"Wh-What is it!?"
I look in the direction Narumi-san is staring, but I can only see the corridor through the dining hall door.
#Narumi
"Just now... Akane was..."
#Satoshi
"What!?"
I step out into the corridor with Narumi-san.
There's no sign of Akane-san anywhere.
#Satoshi
"Do you know what she was doing?"
#Narumi
"She came out of Akane's room... and seemed to head for the hall..."
While saying that, Narumi-san puts her hand on the door to Akane-san's room.
#Narumi
"It's locked... That's strange..."
I try twisting the doorknob too, but it seems to be locked after all.
#Satoshi
"Are you sure you didn't misidentify her?"
#Narumi
"Hmm... I only saw her from behind, so..."
#Satoshi
"...I'll go look for her."
It's better to take action than to stand here worrying.
#Narumi
"Ah, yeah. ...Be careful, you never know what might happen."
#Satoshi
"...Yeah."
I parted ways with Narumi-san.
If Akane-san really was there, what on earth is she doing...?
When I entered the dining hall, Narumi-san approached me with a worried expression.
#Narumi
"Did you find Akane?"
#Satoshi
"No... I couldn't find her."
I shake my head.
#Narumi
"I see..."
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll try looking a little more."
I turn on my heel and head back out into the corridor.
