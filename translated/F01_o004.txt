＃Souko
「The room Mr. Kousei used to use, right. I'm curious, but if we can't get in, there's no helping it.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah.」
＃Maya
「It is the room my husband used while he was alive. We have left it exactly as it was.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Ai
「That is the room my father used. I have hardly ever set foot in there myself.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Benio
「My father's room. It is locked now so that no one can enter.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「That is the room the Master used to use, but it is kept locked now. I am the one in charge of the key.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Rokuyou
「The previous head's room... I've never been inside. I imagine it's filled with nothing but music-related things...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「Mr. Kousei's room is off-limits to everyone. It is not a place that concerns you.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-You're right...」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't know much about that room either. Apparently it was the previous head's room... but I don't think you can see the inside.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「That room... I haven't been inside either, so...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「I hear that room is preserved exactly as it was when the Master was alive... but I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in there.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
