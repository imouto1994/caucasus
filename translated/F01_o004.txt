"The room Mr. Kousei used to use, right. I'm curious, but if we can't get in, there's no helping it."
#Satoshi
"Yeah."
#Maya
"It is the room my husband used while he was alive. We have left it exactly as it was."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"That is the room my father used. I have hardly ever set foot in there myself."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"My father's room. It is locked now so that no one can enter."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That is the room the Master used to use, but it is kept locked now. I am the one in charge of the key."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Rokuyou
"The previous head's room... I've never been inside. I imagine it's filled with nothing but music-related things..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Mr. Kousei's room is off-limits to everyone. It is not a place that concerns you."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Mikanagi
"I don't know much about that room either. Apparently it was the previous head's room... but I don't think you can see the inside."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"That room... I haven't been inside either, so..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I hear that room is preserved exactly as it was when the Master was alive... but I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in there."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
