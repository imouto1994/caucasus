"So that was Shion-san's room... She’s the only one living out there in the annex, isn't she?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah..."
#Maya
"That is the room of my youngest daughter, Shion. Her health is delicate, so we have her stay in the annex."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"...Yes, that is Shion's room. Because her body is weak, she has lived there for a very long time."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"If you want to get to the tower, your only option is to go through the door at the back of the office."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Tsujimura
"With all this snow, I shall have to do some shoveling myself. It would be a disaster if Lady Shion were to trip and fall."
#Protagonist
"You're right."
#Takamine
"...I’ve heard that Shion-kun has lived in that tower since long ago."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Mikanagi
"I’m told Shion-san lives in the annex due to her poor health... but it’s possible my father was the one who gave those instructions..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"I’m the one who brings Lady Shion her meals, though she usually eats them in the office."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Narumi
"Only Lady Shion lives out in the annex... It’s a bit strange, isn't it?"
#Protagonist
"It is..."
