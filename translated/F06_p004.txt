"It seems Benio-san is also concerned about that explosion. It would certainly be strange to think nothing of it..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Souko
"To think Benio-san would be murdered too... it feels like we’re narrowing down the victims and suspects, but..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Maya
"As for Benio... I'd rather she not get involved in anything dangerous..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Maya
"Why Benio too... I told her to stop getting involved in dangerous things..."
＃Protagonist
"Maya-san..."
＃Ai
"...Since I was targeted, I think there's a possibility the culprit might be after Benio too..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Ai
"Ah... Benio...! Why, why did you have to die...!!"
＃Protagonist
"Ai-san..."
＃Benio
"Don't worry about me. There's no need to be concerned."
＃Protagonist
"Really...?"
＃Tsujimura
"Lady Benio is also in danger, so I wish she would stay quiet... but I doubt she'll listen..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Tsujimura
"If even Lady Benio has been taken from us... what is to become of us now...?"
＃Protagonist
"...I don't know."
＃Takamine
"I don't know what Benio-kun is thinking about this whole situation, but she seems to be investigating things."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Even Benio-kun was killed... hurry up and find the culprit."
＃Protagonist
"Y-Yeah..."
＃Mikanagi
"Benio-san seems to be looking into various things as well."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"During the time frame Benio-san was killed... no one has an alibi. In other words, anyone could be the culprit."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
