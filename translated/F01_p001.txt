"You want to hear about me? You already know, don't you?"
#Satoshi
"No, come on, give me something."

"Your university senior and an unparalleled Cola lover. Will that do?"
#Satoshi
"...Not really."
#Souko
"Well then, shall I say I'm a folklorist who came here for research?"

"Souko-san, you're still a student too."

"Ms. Kirihara? ...I don't know her well, but..."
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."

"Kirihara... ah, her. There's no reason I would know anything, is there?"
#Satoshi
"Y-You're right..."
#Mikanagi
"Kirihara-san? ...Well, I can't really say..."
#Satoshi
"...I guess that's true."
#Akane
"Ms. Kirihara? I believe she would be in her room."
#Satoshi
"Uh... I suppose she would..."
#Narumi
"Ms. Kirihara? ...No, I don't know her."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
