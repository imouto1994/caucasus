I've returned to my room.

"Phew……"
I flop down onto the bed.
I feel strangely exhausted.
I suppose it's only natural…… Rokuyou-san was killed this morning, and Ai-san was killed at midday……
The culprit must still be lurking somewhere.
The culprit…… who could it be?
I don't want to doubt anyone, but the culprit must undoubtedly be among the people I've met here.
If this series of crimes is related to the inheritance, it doesn't explain why Rokuyou-san was killed first.
He had no right to the inheritance to begin with.
That being said, I haven't found any other clues that link the two incidents.
Except for the fact that Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were on good terms.
Even if I wanted to ask for more details, Ai-san is already——
I close my eyes.
I'll sleep…… just for a bit.
I've locked the door, so it should be fine.
Besides…… I'm an outsider, so there's no reason for me to be targeted.
……Though that doesn't mean I can afford to be careless.
