When I arrived at the grand hall, I found Akane-san alone, wiping down the tables.
＃Akane
「Ah...」
Noticing me, Akane-san stopped what she was doing.
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Akane-san.」
＃Akane
「Did you need something?」
When I entered the grand hall, Akane-san appeared to still be cleaning.
＃Akane
「Oh, what is it this time?」
There was no one in the grand hall.
Now... what should I do?
