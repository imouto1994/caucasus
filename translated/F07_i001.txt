"You want to ask about cola? Let's see, I was the very first person in Japan to drink cola. Impressive, right?"
#Satoshi
"...I can tell that's a lie, even for me."
#Maya
"Cola... is it? Unfortunately, I have never drunk it."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Ai
"Cola? I've heard of it... that's what Kirihara-san was drinking, wasn't it?"
#Satoshi
"Yes, that's right."
#Benio
"I drink cola occasionally. That fizzy feeling is irresistible."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Shion
"Cola... is it? Well... I don't know what that is..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Cola, is it... I remember getting some from the occupation forces a long time ago. It must be nearly twenty years ago now..."
#Satoshi
"Huh... I see."
#Takamine
"Cola? I don't drink such things."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Cola contains a lot of caffeine, you know. You should be careful, as drinking too much might keep you from sleeping."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
#Akane
"Cola? ...I'm sorry, we don't have any prepared here..."
#Satoshi
"Ah, no, it's fine. Souko-san brought plenty."
#Narumi
"Cola? ...Come to think of it, I heard that simmering chicken in cola makes it delicious."
#Satoshi
"...Don't ask me, ask Souko-san for some."
