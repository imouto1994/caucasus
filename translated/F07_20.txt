I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
#Ai
"Oh... is something the matter?"
#Satoshi
"Hello. Could I have a little bit of your time?"
#Ai
"Yes, of course. Please, come in."
With that, Ai-san invited me into the room.
#Ai
"So, what is it you need?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
I knock lightly and wait.
#Ai
"Oh... was there something else?"
#Satoshi
"Hello. Could I have a little bit of your time?"
#Ai
"Yes, go ahead."
With that, Ai-san invited me into the room.
#Ai
"What might your business be?"
#Satoshi
"Uh, well..."
I've come to the front of Ai-san's room.
Ai-san's body is laid to rest here.
I pull back my hand from the doorknob and decide to go somewhere else.
