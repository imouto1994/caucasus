「Mikanagi-sensei.」
I called out to Mikanagi-sensei as soon as we entered the infirmary.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, what is it? ...Shion-san?」
＃Ai
「Shion... says her head hurts...」
＃Mikanagi
「...Please, lay her down on that bed over there.」
Following Mikanagi-sensei’s instructions, Ai-san and I helped Shion-san to the bed.
＃Mikanagi
「I'll need Shion-san’s medicine, then...」
Mikanagi-sensei pulled some medicine from the cabinet against the wall.
＃Protagonist
「Is that herbal medicine?」
The shelves were lined with things that looked like tree roots.
＃Mikanagi
「Yes. It’s more effective this way. It takes a little time to decoct, but since Shion-san’s headaches are chronic, I always have some ready.」
He poured the medicine into an earthenware pot and set it over the fire.
＃Mikanagi
「I'm decocting kakkon, shakuyaku, keishi, bushi, and several others.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「It’ll take some time to reheat, so you can head back now.」
＃Protagonist
「...Alright.」
It was true that there was no point in me staying here.
＃Protagonist
「Well then... take care, Shion-san.」
I spoke to her as she lay on the bed and left the infirmary.
