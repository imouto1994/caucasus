"I went to check on things because I felt a bit restless after my shower. That’s when I found Mikanagi-sensei… you know."
#Satoshi
"Is that so…?"
#Maya
"I wouldn't know, I was resting in my room as well."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Ai
"I’m not sure… I was in my room the entire time."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Tsujimura
"If you mean Kirihara-sama, I believe she was in her room the whole time, but…"
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Takamine
"I wouldn’t know what was happening outside my room."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Akane
"Perhaps she was in her room…?"
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Narumi
"…At the very least, she didn’t leave her room while I was out here in the second-floor hallway."
#Satoshi
"…I see."
