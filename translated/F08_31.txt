"Excuse me."
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's somewhere else.
In that case, there's no point in staying here.
I'll go somewhere else.
＃Protagonist
"Hello, Mikanagi-sensei."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
＃Mikanagi
"Ah, what is it?"
＃Protagonist
"Um... have you seen Kirihara?"
＃Mikanagi
"I've been back in my room since I parted ways with you earlier. Before that... I saw her on the first floor after six."
＃Protagonist
"And after that?"
＃Mikanagi
"I predictably wouldn't know. There was nothing strange about her, though..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"Have you still not found her?"
＃Protagonist
"No... I haven't."
＃Mikanagi
"And Akane-san hasn't been found either... That's worrying..."
＃Protagonist
"Please let me know immediately if anything happens."
＃Mikanagi
"Yeah, understood."
I decided to go somewhere else.
＃Protagonist
"Mikanagi-sensei."
＃Mikanagi
"It seems you still haven't found Kirihara-san."
＃Protagonist
"No... I'll try looking in other places."
I decided to go somewhere else.
