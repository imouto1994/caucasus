"Excuse me."
I spoke up before entering the infirmary, but Mikanagi-sensei wasn't there.
I wonder if he's somewhere else.
In that case, there's no point in staying here.
I'll go somewhere else.
#Satoshi
"Hello, Mikanagi-sensei."
When I entered the infirmary, Mikanagi-sensei looked up from his desk.
#Mikanagi
"Ah, what is it?"
#Satoshi
"Um... have you seen Kirihara?"
#Mikanagi
"I've been back in my room since I parted ways with you earlier. Before that... I saw her on the first floor after six."
#Satoshi
"And after that?"
#Mikanagi
"I predictably wouldn't know. There was nothing strange about her, though..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"Have you still not found her?"
#Satoshi
"No... I haven't."
#Mikanagi
"And Akane-san hasn't been found either... That's worrying..."
#Satoshi
"Please let me know immediately if anything happens."
#Mikanagi
"Yeah, understood."
I decided to go somewhere else.
#Satoshi
"Mikanagi-sensei."
#Mikanagi
"It seems you still haven't found Kirihara-san."
#Satoshi
"No... I'll try looking in other places."
I decided to go somewhere else.
