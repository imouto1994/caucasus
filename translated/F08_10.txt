I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she's not here after all.
I wonder where on earth Akane-san could be...
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
I've come to the front of Akane-san's room.
I can't get in here because Narumi-san locked it earlier.
But... what on earth is Akane-san doing?
There are too many mysteries surrounding her actions.
This mansion is large, but there are only so many places to hide in this Nanatsukikan. Where could she be hiding...
Or, perhaps, already?
I haven't seen Akane-san directly.
At worst, this could all be an act by Narumi-san.
I don't want to be that suspicious, but...
I'll stop, there'll be no end to it.
I decided to look elsewhere.
