Benio-san stepped out into the hallway and began explaining the layout of the house.
＃Benio
「The room on the entrance side of the drawing room is used for storage. Directly across from it is the telephone room, and right next to that is the office.」
She pointed them out one by one as she gave us the tour.
＃Benio
「At the very end of this hall is the Great Hall. It's a space where everyone can relax and unwind.」
With that, she pulled the door open.
The room inside was far larger than the drawing room from before.
Two men were sitting on a sofa in the center, engaged in a lively conversation.
I suppose it was only natural for there to be other guests, considering a wedding was about to take place.
＃Benio
「Isamu-sama, Hakase. Allow me to introduce the guests I mentioned earlier.」
Benio-san called out to the two men.
＃Benio
「This is Mikanagi-sensei, our family's attending physician, and Rokuyou Isamu-sama, the star of today's ceremony.」
＃???
「Hello there. My name is Hiroshi Mikanagi. So, you're the ones who were stranded?」
＃Souko
「I am Souko Kirihara.」
He offered his hand to Souko-san for a handshake.
＃Souko
「...Are you a doctor?」
＃Mikanagi
「My father served as the physician here as well, and I took over for him. My name is actually 'Hiroshi,' but Benio-san here has always called me 'Hakase.'」
He gave a cheerful laugh, then looked down at the hand he was holding and tilted his head slightly.
＃Mikanagi
「...Oh? It looks like you've injured your pinky finger.」
He seemed to notice the way Souko-san was favoring her finger.
＃Souko
「I bumped it while we were walking outside. Could I get a compress or something for it later?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, of course. It would be a problem if there's any damage to the bone, so perhaps I should give it a proper examination?」
＃Souko
「No, that won't be necessary.」
＃???
「Now, now, Doctor. It’s poor form to start wooing a lady the moment you meet her. You’re making the young man next to her uncomfortable.」
The man sitting next to him?Isamu Rokuyou?spoke up.
＃Mikanagi
「Haha, my apologies. I assure you, I had no such intentions.」
＃Rokuyou
「And your name is?」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, me? My name is (NAME01) (NAME02). Um, congratulations on your marriage.」
＃Rokuyou
「Ah, thank you.」
＃Mikanagi
「Still, I was quite surprised to hear Isamu was finally settling down. Have you managed to settle all your... affairs yet?」
＃Protagonist
「Settle his affairs?」
＃Mikanagi
「He used to be quite the playboy, you see. There are likely many things he needs to tidy up.」
＃Rokuyou
「Don't go spreading such nasty rumors, Doctor. I wasn't nearly as wild as you.」
Rokuyou-san gave Mikanagi-sensei a playful nudge, though he didn't seem truly angry.
＃Mikanagi
「I'll have you know, I always intend for my romances to be serious.」
＃Benio
「Both of you, please. You're appalling our guests.」
Benio-san chided the two laughing men.
Mikanagi-sensei turned toward me with a chuckle.
＃Mikanagi
「You're a lucky man, being here with such a beautiful girlfriend.」
＃Protagonist
「It's nothing like that.」
＃Souko
「I wonder why people always assume the worst whenever a man and a woman are seen together.」
Souko-san muttered, sounding thoroughly exasperated.
Well, it’s true that we aren't lovers.
In fact, I doubt our relationship would ever develop into something like that. Souko-san and I are just too poorly matched for it.
＃Rokuyou
「Are you two students?」
Rokuyou-san directed his question toward me.
＃Protagonist
「Yes. We attend a university in Tokyo. Souko-san?she’s my senior in the folklore seminar.」
＃Rokuyou
「Folklore, eh...? Did you perhaps come here to research this place?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... rather than this house specifically, we're interested in the legends of Nanatsuki Village.」
＃Rokuyou
「It's one and the same. Most of the lore in Nanatsuki Village originated with the Nanatsuki family.」
＃Protagonist
「I heard their ancestors were quite infatuated with Western culture.」
＃Rokuyou
「So it seems. Though most of it is nothing more than rumors. The countryside is always full of talk like that.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Rokuyou
「I've heard plenty of strange stories since I started heading out to sea, but I've rarely encountered a place as peculiar as this.」
＃Protagonist
「To sea...?」
But we're so deep in the mountains here...
＃Rokuyou
「My family are distant relatives of the Nanatsukis. We run a trading business in Ishinomaki, Miyagi. It's only a small company, though, so I often board the ships myself.」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, wow...」
He didn't look much like a man of the sea, but perhaps that was because it was a merchant vessel.
＃Rokuyou
「Though, I haven't been on a ship lately, as I've been staying here for quite some time now.」
With that, Rokuyou-san let a faint smile play across his lips.
＃Rokuyou
「On a day with such fierce winds, I'm glad I'm not out on a boat.」
He was right; the windows were rattling under the force of the gale.
The snow seemed to be coming down much harder now as well.
＃Rokuyou
「...Oh, that's right. Benio, about that thing you asked for... one of our employees found it in London.」
＃Benio
「Oh, really?」
＃Protagonist
「What did they find?」
＃Rokuyou
「What was it called again... I believe it was a cursed?」
Before Rokuyou-san could finish, Benio-san clamped both hands over his mouth.
＃Benio
「You mustn't say another word about that, Isamu-sama!」
Rokuyou-san nodded silently.
＃Protagonist
「A cursed... what?」
＃Benio
「It's nothing?nothing at all.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Isamu-sama, I really must introduce our guests to the others, so we'll be taking our leave now.」
＃Rokuyou
「Right, I understand. Maybe you should tell the Doctor instead of me, though.」
Rokuyou-san pointed toward Mikanagi-sensei and Souko-san.
The doctor seemed to be having a very enjoyable conversation with her.
＃Benio
「Hakase.」
＃Mikanagi
「Ah, my apologies. I got a bit carried away.」
＃Souko
「No, please don't mind me. I enjoyed our talk.」
Souko-san took a step back and gave a polite bow.
＃Mikanagi
「See you later.」
＃Protagonist
「Excuse us, then.」
I bowed as well and stepped out of the Great Hall.
＃Benio
「I hope Hakase wasn't too much of a nuisance?」
As soon as we were back in the hallway, Benio-san apologized to Souko-san.
＃Souko
「No, it's quite alright.」
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san, did you have him look at your hand?」
＃Souko
「Just a light palpation. He told me not to move it too much, as there's a chance it might be broken.」
＃Protagonist
「Are you going to be okay?」
＃Souko
「It shouldn't be a problem for everyday life.」
Souko-san replied while carefully flexing her fingers.
＃Protagonist
「By the way, Benio-san...」
＃Benio
「Yes, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「It sounded like you asked Rokuyou-san for something?something about a curse?」
＃Benio
「...Oh, you must have imagined it.」
＃Souko
「A curse...?」
＃Benio
「...I simply have an interest in Western occultism and the like.」
＃Protagonist
「Occultism? Is that like religious studies?」
＃Souko
「...Well, it’s close, I suppose...」
Souko-san’s voice trailed off vaguely.
