Ai-san straightened her disheveled clothes and stood up.
#Ai
"...Thank you very much."
#Main Character
"...Please, don't. I haven't done anything—I couldn't even save Benio-san."
#Ai
"But... you saved my heart."
Ai-san bowed her head deeply.
#Ai
"Of course, the wound from losing Benio remains... but I feel like I can go on without being crushed by it."
#Main Character
"I see..."
I didn't feel like I’d done anything special.
Ai-san had simply made the decision to overcome Benio-san's death.
But... no matter what happens from now on, I want to support Ai-san.
First—I have to find a way to fix this ridiculous situation.
#Main Character
"...Ai-san, please stay cooped up in your room. Don't open the door for anyone, no matter who it is."
#Ai
"You’re going, then...?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... if I don't move, I don't think I'll ever find the culprit."
#Ai
"I see... please, be careful..."
#Main Character
"Yeah. ...Well then."
I gave Ai-san a kiss and then left her room.
