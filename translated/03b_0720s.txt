The piano keys where Benio-san lay slumped.
Blood had splattered across them, staining them bright red.
＃Protagonist
「...There are scratches on the keys.」
Right next to the severed surface of the neck, there were scratches as if made by something.
＃Souko
「I wonder if they were made when the head was cut off...」
＃Mikanagi
「That might be it. Since the neck was likely severed with a saw, the tip of the blade probably hit the keys.」
＃Protagonist
「A saw...?」
That would make it different from when Rokuyou-san was killed...
＃Souko
「If it had been an axe, it wouldn't have left such small scratches. The keys are broken.」
＃Mikanagi
「Judging from the amount of blood, there's no doubt the decapitation occurred here.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
The head was likely severed with a saw.
Fresh blood had splattered onto the black piano as well.
Benio-san...
Perhaps because she always kept it clean, no fingerprint-like smudges were visible.
＃Protagonist
「...A snowdrop.」
A single white flower had fallen into the pool of blood.
＃Protagonist
「Is it the same as with Rokuyou-san...?」
＃Souko
「Most likely...」
＃Protagonist
「Another snowdrop...」
A single white flower had fallen into the pool of blood.
＃Protagonist
「Once again, just like with Rokuyou-san and Ai-san...」
＃Protagonist
「What is this flower...?」
A single white flower had fallen into the pool of blood.
Why in a place like this...
＃Souko
「It's a snowdrop. There were some arranged in the hall... but the fact that only the flower part has fallen, I wonder if it's a metaphor for a headless corpse...」
＃Protagonist
「...That's a sickening thought.」
The snowdrop flower lay there.
Benio-san's corpse lay face down on the piano keys.
＃Protagonist
「Can you tell the cause of death...?」
＃Mikanagi
「I wonder... other than the neck where the severed surface is jagged, no other damage is visible... either a blow to the head, or strangulation...」
＃Souko
「...What about the possibility of poison?」
＃Mikanagi
「I can't say it's impossible. There are livor mortis on her legs, but it's hard to distinguish the color... there's no doubt she's been in this seated position for a long time.」
＃Souko
「I see... we can't perform an autopsy here, after all...」
＃Mikanagi
「That sort of thing should be left to the police.」
Benio-san's headless body lay face down on the piano.
