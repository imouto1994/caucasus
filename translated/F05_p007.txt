「Attorney Takamine can be a bit rough with his language, but he's not a bad person.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「I hear Takamine-san used to come here since he was a child, brought along by his father.」
＃Protagonist
「Was that so?」

「Mr. Takamine... um, I hear he works as an attorney... I don't really understand it...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「Takamine-sama is a serious person... He's someone who isn't afraid to have a differing opinion.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「What about me?」
＃Protagonist
「No, it's nothing...」
＃Mikanagi
「Takamine-san is headstrong. Perhaps that's why he's suited to being an attorney.」

「Takamine-sama? I believe he’s in his room...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「He has a bit of an unpleasant vibe... I don't like men who are so full of suspicion like that.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I see...」
