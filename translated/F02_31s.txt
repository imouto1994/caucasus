Small medicine vials are lined up here.
With my limited knowledge, I have almost no idea what kind of medicines they are.
I can't go meddling with them, so I'll just leave them be.
It’s probably best not to meddle with it.
It contains things that look like medicine.
Maybe it’s for herbal medicine; there are even things that look like tree roots stored here.
It’s probably best not to meddle with it.
There seem to be disinfectants and bandages kept here.

Some documents have been left on the desk.
I shouldn't really go looking at them without permission.
There are documents here.
Snow is fluttering outside the window.
I wonder when this blizzard is ever going to let up...
The storm outside seems to be getting even more violent.
There's a door other than the one I entered through.
It likely connects to the library next door.
It appears to be a door connecting to the next room over.
There's a simple bed here, completely different from the ones in the other rooms.
Well, it is an infirmary, so that makes sense...
There is no sign of the bed having been used.
Various documents are filed away.
I really shouldn't be looking at them without permission...

In the bottom drawer, I found a pretty card.
#Protagonist
"What's this...?"
The card has the letter 'r' written on it.
I’m a bit curious, so I think I’ll hang onto it.
There’s another piece of paper inside.
"Campaign in progress! Collect similar cards and solve the problem! This is what the answer section on the survey postcard was for!"
#Protagonist
"...What the hell is this?"
Well, I’m at least a little curious, so I’ll hold onto this card.
There’s another piece of paper inside.
"Now all the cards have been collected! Now for the burning question... if you rearrange the letters so far, they form a certain word."
"Answer with the Japanese translation most suitable for this work and send in your survey postcard!"
"Deadline is January 11, 2010, postmark valid! We’ll send a small gift to 10 lucky winners!"
#Protagonist
"...Geez."
I kind of get it, but I kind of don't...
There's nothing particularly unusual inside.
