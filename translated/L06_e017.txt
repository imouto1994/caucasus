"...It was only about ten minutes between the second blackout and the discovery of the body... It wouldn't be impossible to take off a head in that time, but still..."

"True..."
#Shion
"Lady Ai... why...?"
#Satoshi
"Shion-san..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Ai... How tragic..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Takamine
"To think even Ai-kun would be killed... Just what on earth is happening here?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Mikanagi
"...It was likely a saw that severed the neck. I imagine they did it in the bathtub with the water running to wash away the blood as they worked."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Lady Ai... Why did this happen...?"
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Narumi
"...The fact that Lady Ai was murdered might mean that no one is safe... except for the killer."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
