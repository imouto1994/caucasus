I arrived in front of Ai-san's room.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san, it's me.」
The door opened, and Ai-san emerged.
＃Ai
「Oh... did something happen?」
＃Protagonist
「Umm... it hasn't been confirmed that you're safe yet, so I thought I'd try to protect you somehow.」
＃Ai
「Eh...?」
＃Protagonist
「Um... I'll stay in this room tonight to protect you.」
＃Ai
「That's... um, I'm happy you'd offer, but...」
Ai-san seems troubled.
＃Ai
「Well... Mother is right next door, and so is Benio...」
＃Protagonist
「No, no! I didn't come here with any illicit intentions!」
I waved my hands in front of me to deny it.
＃Protagonist
「I just wanted to protect you, Ai-san...」
＃Ai
「I... thank you very much for that. But... well, spending the night in the same room is a bit...」
＃Protagonist
「Then I could stay in the hallway—」
＃Ai
「No. You'll catch a cold. I'll stay in my room with the door locked, so please get some rest in your own room too.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... but please make sure not to let your guard down.」
＃Ai
「Yes, I know. Thank you.」
＃Protagonist
「...Phew.」
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
