「I suppose that's about it.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah……」
In the end, I felt like I hadn't been able to ask anything that really got to the heart of the matter.
＃Benio
「Well then, shall we disperse? It's probably best not to leave our rooms too much tonight.」
＃Souko
「You're right…… what should we do about dinner?」
＃Akane
「In that case, Narumi-san and I will bring it to everyone's rooms later.」
＃Narumi
「There shouldn't be a problem if the two of us carry it, right?」
Saying so, Narumi-san glanced over at Lawyer Takamine.
＃Takamine
「Hmph……」
＃Akane
「Then it's settled. Narumi-san, let's go.」
＃Narumi
「Right, right.」
The two of them left the Great Hall.
Following their lead, one by one, everyone else left the room.
……I should head back to my room as well.
