I returned to my own room.
Now then... what should I do next?
#Main Character
"Oh..."
It seemed someone had arrived.
#Main Character
"Who is it...?"
I called out while opening the door.
#Narumi
"Ah, there you are."
Narumi-san was standing in the corridor.
#Main Character
"What is the matter...?"
#Narumi
"I have something I need to talk to you about."
With those words, she slipped inside the room.
#Main Character
"What is it...?"
#Narumi
"It's about Akane, just for a moment."
#Main Character
"Akane-san...?"
Did she find something out?
#Main Character
"Was she found...?"
#Narumi
"...Not yet. I've searched all the places I was concerned about, but..."
#Main Character
"I doubt it, but... could she be the one who attacked Benio-san...?"
#Narumi
"I don't think so. There's no reason... probably."
#Main Character
"I see..."
Even so, I couldn't just leave it be.
#Main Character
"I'll try searching a little more myself."
#Narumi
"Yes, I'm counting on you."
