I returned to my own room.
Now then... what should I do next?
＃Protagonist
「Oh...」
It seemed someone had arrived.
＃Protagonist
「Who is it...?」
I called out while opening the door.
＃Narumi
「Ah, there you are.」
Narumi-san was standing in the corridor.
＃Protagonist
「What is the matter...?」
＃Narumi
「I have something I need to talk to you about.」
With those words, she slipped inside the room.
＃Protagonist
「What is it...?」
＃Narumi
「It's about Akane, just for a moment.」
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san...?」
Did she find something out?
＃Protagonist
「Was she found...?」
＃Narumi
「...Not yet. I've searched all the places I was concerned about, but...」
＃Protagonist
「I doubt it, but... could she be the one who attacked Benio-san...?」
＃Narumi
「I don't think so. There's no reason... probably.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
Even so, I couldn't just leave it be.
＃Protagonist
「I'll try searching a little more myself.」
＃Narumi
「Yes, I'm counting on you.」
