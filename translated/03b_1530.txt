I went up the stairs.
Since Akane-san had gone to check on Dr. Mikanagi, she should be on the north side where my room was.
Peering into the clinic, I found Akane-san there, all alone.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... Akane-san?」
＃Akane
「Hyaah!?」
Akane-san nearly jumped out of her skin as she whirled around.
For some reason, she was clutching Dr. Mikanagi's white coat.
＃Protagonist
「Uh... what are you doing?」
＃Akane
「N-nothing at all!?」
In a state of extreme panic, she began to fold the white coat.
＃Protagonist
「...Where is Dr. Mikanagi?」
＃Akane
「H-he's returned to his room...!」
＃Protagonist
「So his safety’s been confirmed. That’s a relief.」
＃Akane
「Y-yes...」
Well... I figured it was best not to dig any deeper.
＃Protagonist
「If everything’s fine, I'll head back. Akane-san, please try not to wander around too much.」
＃Akane
「Yes! Understood.」
