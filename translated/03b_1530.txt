I went up the stairs.
Since Akane-san had gone to check on Dr. Mikanagi, she should be on the north side where my room was.
Peering into the clinic, I found Akane-san there, all alone.
#Main Character
"Oh... Akane-san?"
#Akane
"Hyaah!?"
Akane-san nearly jumped out of her skin as she whirled around.
For some reason, she was clutching Dr. Mikanagi's white coat.
#Main Character
"Uh... what are you doing?"
#Akane
"N-nothing at all!?"
In a state of extreme panic, she began to fold the white coat.
#Main Character
"...Where is Dr. Mikanagi?"
#Akane
"H-he's returned to his room...!"
#Main Character
"So his safety’s been confirmed. That’s a relief."
#Akane
"Y-yes..."
Well... I figured it was best not to dig any deeper.
#Main Character
"If everything’s fine, I'll head back. Akane-san, please try not to wander around too much."
#Akane
"Yes! Understood."
