"If they were cut deliberately... then it must be the killer's work."
#Satoshi
"Most likely..."
#Maya
"The phone lines were cut... What ever shall we do..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Ai
"What should we do now..."
#Satoshi
"Good question..."
#Benio
"Cutting the phone lines was likely to sever our contact with the outside world. This doesn't look like it's over yet..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Shion
"The phone won't connect... I've never used it, so I don't really understand..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"If the phone lines were cut along with the suspension bridge... it would be difficult for an amateur to restore them..."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Takamine
"The phone lines were cut at the suspension bridge. It was probably the same person."
#Satoshi
"Right."
#Mikanagi
"We can't even call the police if the phones don't work... It'll be a problem if anything else happens..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Akane
"What are we going to do..."
#Satoshi
"I don't know..."
#Narumi
"...If they cut the phone lines, we can't report this to the police. We're completely isolated now."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
