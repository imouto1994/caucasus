#Souko
"...There aren't many people here."
It didn't look like everyone in the mansion had gathered.
#Akane
"The Madam and Ai-ojousama are in the infirmary. Dr. Mikanagi is with them as well..."
#Protagonist
"What about Shion-san?"
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama is in her own room."
#Souko
"...I see."
Souko-san looked a bit dissatisfied.
#Takamine
"It hardly matters, does it? Just get on with it."
Takamine-san spoke up, making no effort to hide his foul mood.
#Souko
"...I suppose we have no choice. Alright, we're going to ask you about a few things that have been bothering us."
