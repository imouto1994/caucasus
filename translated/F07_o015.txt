"There was an incident like this before...? But if no one died, it wouldn't be considered a similar incident. It seems Tsujimura-san is hiding something..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
#Maya
"A similar incident... No, I've never heard of such a thing..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"A similar incident... It would be a problem if things like this happened all the time."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Benio
"Something like this happened before... Is that what Tsujimura said? ...In that case, it must be something related to the 'Curse of the Seven Possessed'..."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
#Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"That was... well, it was a long time ago..."
#Satoshi
"...Please tell me, Tsujimura-san. Even if it was a long time ago... what happened? It might be connected to what's happening now."
#Tsujimura
"B-But... I am sorry, I simply cannot..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"A similar incident, huh..."
#Satoshi
"Do you know something?"
#Takamine
"...No, I don't."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Mikanagi
"A similar incident... I can't really say."
#Satoshi
"Right..."
#Akane
"Similar... No, I'm sorry... I don't really know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I don't really know about that."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
