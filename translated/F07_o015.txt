「There was an incident like this before...? But if no one died, it wouldn't be considered a similar incident. It seems Tsujimura-san is hiding something...」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe so...」
＃Maya
「A similar incident... No, I've never heard of such a thing...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Ai
「A similar incident... It would be a problem if things like this happened all the time.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Benio
「Something like this happened before... Is that what Tsujimura said? ...In that case, it must be something related to the 'Curse of the Seven Possessed'...」
＃Protagonist
「Maybe so...」
＃Shion
「Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「That was... well, it was a long time ago...」
＃Protagonist
「...Please tell me, Tsujimura-san. Even if it was a long time ago... what happened? It might be connected to what's happening now.」
＃Tsujimura
「B-But... I am sorry, I simply cannot...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「A similar incident, huh...」
＃Protagonist
「Do you know something?」
＃Takamine
「...No, I don't.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」
＃Mikanagi
「A similar incident... I can't really say.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Akane
「Similar... No, I'm sorry... I don't really know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「I don't really know about that.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
