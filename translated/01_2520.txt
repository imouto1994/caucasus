I returned to my own room.
＃Souko
「It looks like we'll have to ask the lawyer about the will.」
＃Protagonist
「I'm not sure if he'll actually tell us anything, but... wait, Souko-san?」
＃Souko
「Hm, what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「What are you doing in my room?」
＃Souko
「I'm here to discuss what we're going to do starting tomorrow, obviously.」
Souko-san sat down on the edge of the bed.
＃Protagonist
「Tomorrow... well, if the snow has stopped, we're heading home, right?」
I spoke aloud what was surely the least likely possibility.
＃Souko
「If the snow has stopped... we'll head into Nanatsuki Village and gather information.」
＃Protagonist
「...So we really are going to keep going with this.」
＃Souko
「Of course we are. That's why we came here in the first place.」
Souko-san let her body fall back onto the bed.
＃Souko
「Phew... but honestly, it doesn't look like it's going to stop.」
＃Protagonist
「You think so?」
I walked over to the window and looked outside.
Just as when I had looked through the window in Dr. Mikanagi's room earlier, I could see the dark tower standing there.
While the snow was still falling, it had weakened considerably.
＃Protagonist
「Well, with this much snow piled up, it looks like it would be a struggle just to walk.」
Souko-san didn't give me an answer.
When I turned around, I saw her eyes were closed as she lay on my bed.
＃Protagonist
「...Souko-san?」
＃Souko
「Zzz...」
...She had fallen asleep.
＃Protagonist
「...Souko-san, you're going to catch a cold.」
＃Souko
「...Mmn...」
It was no use.
Once she was like this, she wasn't going to wake up.
I suppose she must have been exhausted...
I'd really wanted to take a bath and freshen up... but I guess it couldn't be helped.
I rolled Souko-san's body over to pull the comforter and blanket out from under her, then draped them over her.
Then, I wrapped myself in a spare blanket and lay down on the floor.
It was a bit chilly.
Thanks to the thick, soft carpet, I figured I'd manage somehow.
As I closed my eyes, a single question drifted through my mind: why was I sleeping on the floor when I had such a nice room to stay in?
