I wonder how much time has passed.
Reacting to the sound of someone descending the stairs in a hurry, I looked out through the grated window.
#Main Character
"Tsujimura-san...?"
#Tsujimura
"So this is where you were..."
#Narumi
"Did something happen?"
#Tsujimura
"W-Well... Benio-ojousama is..."

"Benio-san...? Did something happen to her...?"
I asked with enough force to almost grab Tsujimura-san by the collar.
#Tsujimura
"In... in the performance room..."
I burst out immediately.
#Tsujimura
"Ah...!"
#Main Character
"Sorry!"
After confirming that Narumi-san was supporting the staggering Tsujimura-san, I dashed up the stairs.
The performance room.
Benio-san is in the performance room—
