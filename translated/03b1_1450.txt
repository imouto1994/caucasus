I wonder how much time has passed.
Reacting to the sound of someone descending the stairs in a hurry, I looked out through the grated window.
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san...?」
＃Tsujimura
「So this is where you were...」
＃Narumi
「Did something happen?」
＃Tsujimura
「W-Well... Benio-ojousama is...」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san...? Did something happen to her...?」
I gripped the grate tight.
＃Tsujimura
「In... in the performance room...」
Tsujimura-san removed the bar that had been stuck.
I burst out immediately.
＃Tsujimura
「Ah...!」
＃Protagonist
「Sorry!」
After confirming that Narumi-san was supporting the staggering Tsujimura-san, I dashed up the stairs.
The performance room.
Benio-san is in the performance room?
I wonder how long I’d been scraping away at the wall.
Suddenly, a hole gaped open with a dull thud.
＃Protagonist
「It opened...?」
I can see the room on the other side.
It appears to be the machine room.
＃Narumi
「Make the hole wider.」
＃Protagonist
「I-I know.」
My energy returned now that an exit was in sight.
I continued to frantically crumble the wall.
＃Narumi
「Whew... we managed to get out.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
I stood up and stretched.
We managed to get out, but...
Suddenly the door opened, and Tsujimura-san appeared.
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san...?」
＃Tsujimura
「So this is where you were...」
＃Narumi
「Did something happen?」
＃Tsujimura
「W-Well... Benio-ojousama is...」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san...? Did something happen to her...?」
I asked with enough force to almost grab Tsujimura-san by the collar.
＃Tsujimura
「In... in the performance room...」
I burst out immediately.
＃Tsujimura
「Ah...!」
＃Protagonist
「Sorry!」
After confirming that Narumi-san was supporting the staggering Tsujimura-san, I dashed up the stairs.
The performance room.
Benio-san is in the performance room?
