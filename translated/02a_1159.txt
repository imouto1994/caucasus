＃Akane
「This way!」
Akane-san ran down the walkway surrounding the atrium.
At the end was an inconspicuous-looking door.
＃Akane
「There’s a ladder inside that leads to a room above.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood. I'll go first.」
I had no idea what was waiting for us up there.
I swapped places with Akane-san, who had opened the door, and stepped inside.
The sound of my footsteps echoed as I climbed the ladder.
It was pitch black; I couldn't see a thing.
When I reached the top, I realized there was another door right there.
A tiny window in the door allowed a faint sliver of light?perhaps from outside?to spill through.
I peered inside.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san!?」
Ai-san was lying on the floor.
...No, her upper body was slightly suspended.
There was a rope-like object wrapped around her neck, and it was hoisting her up.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san! Are you alright!?」
I grabbed the doorknob, only to jerk my hand back in shock at a sharp prick of pain.
The doorknob and an iron pipe running along the wall had been lashed together with wire.
＃Protagonist
「No... you've got to be kidding me...」
I tried twisting and pulling the knob, but the door wouldn't budge.
However, it didn't seem to be locked.
We were out of time?what should I do?
[Try using a tool]
[Have her go fetch a tool]
[Kick the door down]
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san, can you go find something we can use to get this open?」
＃Akane
「Y-yes! Right away!」
Akane-san scrambled back down the ladder.
Will she make it in time??
＃Protagonist
「Dammit...!」
There was no time for hesitation.
I used every inch of the narrow walkway to back up and then slammed my foot against the door.
＃Protagonist
「Gngh...!」
It didn't even flinch.
Even so, I tried again and again.
I continued to kick the door with everything I had.
Is there... anything I have on me that I can use?
...It's no use.
I can't get this door open like this.
I pulled out a pair of pliers.
＃Protagonist
「If I use these...」
They were rusted, but they should be able to cut through.
＃Protagonist
「Gngh...」
I squeezed with every ounce of strength in my body.
?It snapped.
At the same time, the hinge on the pliers itself gave way and broke.
I tossed the broken tool aside and unwound the remaining wire from the knob.
The door swung open.
It’s thin, but maybe I can break the door with this fire poker.
＃Protagonist
「Take this?!!」
I slammed the fire poker against the doorknob.
＃Protagonist
「Dammit, come on!!」
After striking it repeatedly, the wire slowly but surely began to loosen.
＃Protagonist
「Just a little more?!」
The wire finally snapped and went flying.
＃Protagonist
「Yes!」
The fire poker was ruined, but at least the door was open.
I cleared away the remaining wire and shoved the door open.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san!」
I burst into the mechanical room and rushed to Ai-san’s side.
She seemed to be unconscious.
The rope around her neck was pulled taut, and it wouldn't loosen even when I tried to lift and support her body.
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san, please support Ai-san’s weight!」
＃Akane
「Y-yes...!」
I swapped places with Akane-san and traced the rope to its source.
It was a machine that appeared to be the clock mechanism.
The end of the rope was caught firmly in one of the rotating gears.
Despite the obstruction, the gears were still grinding away.
If this keeps up, Ai-san is going to?!
[Use a tool]
[Remove the rope by hand]
I grabbed the rope and tried to pull it free.
＃Protagonist
「Gngh...!」
It wouldn't budge.
Worse, I could feel wire braided into the rope.
It dug into the flesh of my fingers.
I could feel the mechanism trying to winch me in along with the rope.
＃Protagonist
「Shit?!!」
Is there... anything I have on me that I can use?
It's no use... I can't stop this rope with anything I have?!
Time was heartlessly ticking away.
I jammed the fire poker between the gears.
No matter how powerful the mechanism, it couldn't handle such a large foreign object being shoved into its works.
With a violent screech of grinding metal, the gears ground to a halt.
A gear somewhere must have snapped, because the tension on the rope suddenly vanished.
I grabbed the rope and gave it a hard yank.
The wire-reinforced rope finally came free from the machine.
＃Protagonist
「Akane-san, how is she!?」
＃Akane
「Ojousama! Please, wake up!」
Having removed the rope from Ai-san’s neck, Akane-san began performing artificial respiration.
Is she going to be okay?!?
＃Ai
「...*Cough, cough!*」
...She was alive.
＃Protagonist
「Thank... thank God...」
I slumped to the floor where I stood.
I had managed to save her... somehow.
＃Akane
「Ojousama... thank heaven...」
Akane-san’s eyes welled up with tears.
＃Akane
「...I’ll go fetch Dr. Mikanagi. Please, look after her until I get back.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
Leaving the coughing Ai-san lying on the floor, Akane-san rushed out of the mechanical room.
...It's no use.
A flimsy, bent piece of wood like this is never going to stop that mechanism...
Time was heartlessly ticking away.
I had a knife.
I lunged for the rope and pressed the blade against it.
＃Protagonist
「Ah...」
There was wire braided into the rope.
A small knife like this couldn't even leave a scratch on it.
Even so, I sawed the blade against it again and again.
If there was even the slightest chance, I had to take it.
...The clock's bell began to toll.
But it stopped halfway through.
The mechanism had reached its limit.
Ai-san’s body swayed slightly from the center of the rope, which was now pulled death-tight.
＃Akane
「I brought the pliers... oh...」
Akane-san saw my face and the words died in her throat.
＃Protagonist
「...Let's get it open.」
Maybe there’s still a sliver of hope.
I took the pliers from Akane-san and cut through the wire that was holding the door shut.
No one said a word.
＃Akane
「Ojousama...!」
The door swung open, and Akane-san rushed to Ai-san’s side.
But almost instantly.
＃Akane
「Ojousama... Ai-ojousama...!!」
Akane-san peered into Ai-san’s face and burst into uncontrollable sobbing.
I... I could only stand there, frozen, unable to do a single thing.
...The clock's bell began to toll.
But it stopped halfway through.
The mechanism had reached its limit.
Ai-san’s body swayed slightly from the center of the rope, which was now pulled death-tight.
＃Akane
「No...」
Akane-san covered her face with her hands.
＃Protagonist
「We don't know... we don't know for sure yet. We have to get this open...」
Even as I said the words.
I remembered that if a person is deprived of oxygen for more than a minute, their chances of survival are almost zero.
...The clock's bell began to toll.
But it stopped halfway through.
The mechanism had reached its limit.
Ai-san’s body swayed slightly from the center of the rope, which was now pulled death-tight.
＃Akane
「Ojousama... Ai-ojousama...!!」
Akane-san peered into Ai-san’s face and burst into uncontrollable sobbing.
I... I could only stand there, frozen, unable to do a single thing.
