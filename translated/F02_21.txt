I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Benio
"Yes... oh, it's you."
#Protagonist
"Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?"
#Benio
"I don't mind. Come in."
Benio-san invited me into her room.
#Benio
"So, what is it?"
#Protagonist
"Well, you see..."
I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
#Benio
"Who is it... oh, you again."
#Protagonist
"Hello, Benio-san. Do you have a moment?"
#Benio
"Well, I suppose."
Benio-san invited me into her room.
#Benio
"So, what is it?"
Benio-san asks, turning more serious.
#Protagonist
"Well, you see..."
I’ve come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Huh... I guess she's not here."
There was no response no matter how long I waited.
Nothing for it; let's try somewhere else.
