I reached the central atrium on the second floor and stopped in my tracks.
#Souko
"What's wrong, at this time of night...?"
Souko-san was looking at me with a suspicious expression.
#Main Character
"Souko-san... what are *you* doing up?"
#Souko
"Using the restroom. And you? You looked like you were in quite a hurry."
#Main Character
"No, I... um, I have something to consult with you about."
#Souko
"...Have you reached a conclusion regarding Dr. Mikanagi's murder?"
Souko-san immediately grasped what I was thinking.
#Main Character
"Yes... and I've been thinking about the other matters as well."
#Souko
"...Who do you think is the culprit?"
#Main Character
"...It's Shion-san."
#Souko
"Shion-san...?"
#Main Character
"Yes. In that situation, no one but Shion-san could have killed Dr. Mikanagi."
#Souko
"...You were watching from here with Narumi-san, weren't you?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... so it's almost certain..."
#Souko
"Did you confirm it with her directly?"
#Main Character
"...I did. But I didn't really understand her. It all felt so... inconsistent."
#Souko
"I see... let's go see her once more."
#Main Character
"Yeah..."
I went outside through the back of the office with Souko-san.
The snow had weakened considerably, and the wind was no longer as fierce.
Once dawn breaks—we can go home.
But I hated the idea of just saying goodbye and leaving everything to the police.
Let's end this—with our own hands.
#Souko
"...It's quiet."
Souko-san whispered as we entered the tower.
#Main Character
"Well, Shion-san is the only one living here."
#Souko
"Maybe she's asleep?"
#Main Character
"But I was just talking to her a moment ago... I think she's still awake. Besides, it seems Maya-san came by after I left."
#Souko
"Maya-san...?"
#Main Character
"Yeah. Apparently, she brought Shion-san's medicine..."
#Souko
"I see..."
#Main Character
"So, I think she's still up."
#Souko
"...You're right."
Souko-san began to climb the stairs.
I followed after her.
Souko-san knocked on the door.
#Souko
"...There's no response."
When she turned the knob, the door opened with startling ease.
#Main Character
"Shion-san...?"
Shion-san was slumped over the bed.
#Souko
"No way—"
Souko-san rushed to Shion-san's side.
No way—
#Main Character
"...Souko-san."
Souko-san turned toward me and silently shook her head.
#Main Character
"You're... joking, right...?"
Shion-san didn't move a muscle.
#Main Character
"Why... how could this...!?"
I approached Shion-san.
...She wasn't breathing.
#Souko
"...It looks like poison."
A cup was rolling on the floor.
#Main Character
"What... what do we do now?"
#Souko
"Right... let's investigate, just in case. I'm sure something... has been left behind."
#Main Character
"And if we find nothing...?"
In response to my question, Souko-san let out a light sigh.
#Souko
"...Then everything will likely be handled as Shion-san's suicide."
