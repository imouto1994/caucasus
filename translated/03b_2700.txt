I reached the central atrium on the second floor and stopped in my tracks.
＃Souko
"What's wrong, at this time of night...?"
Souko-san was looking at me with a suspicious expression.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san... what are *you* doing up?"
＃Souko
"Using the restroom. And you? You looked like you were in quite a hurry."
＃Protagonist
"No, I... um, I have something to consult with you about."
＃Souko
"...Have you reached a conclusion regarding Dr. Mikanagi's murder?"
Souko-san immediately grasped what I was thinking.
＃Protagonist
"Yes... and I've been thinking about the other matters as well."
＃Souko
"...Who do you think is the culprit?"
＃Protagonist
"...It's Shion-san."
＃Souko
"Shion-san...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yes. In that situation, no one but Shion-san could have killed Dr. Mikanagi."
＃Souko
"...You were watching from here with Narumi-san, weren't you?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... so it's almost certain..."
＃Souko
"Did you confirm it with her directly?"
＃Protagonist
"...I did. But I didn't really understand her. It all felt so... inconsistent."
＃Souko
"I see... let's go see her once more."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah..."
I went outside through the back of the office with Souko-san.
The snow had weakened considerably, and the wind was no longer as fierce.
Once dawn breaks—we can go home.
But I hated the idea of just saying goodbye and leaving everything to the police.
Let's end this—with our own hands.
＃Souko
"...It's quiet."
Souko-san whispered as we entered the tower.
＃Protagonist
"Well, Shion-san is the only one living here."
＃Souko
"Maybe she's asleep?"
＃Protagonist
"But I was just talking to her a moment ago... I think she's still awake. Besides, it seems Maya-san came by after I left."
＃Souko
"Maya-san...?"
＃Protagonist
"Yeah. Apparently, she brought Shion-san's medicine..."
＃Souko
"I see..."
＃Protagonist
"So, I think she's still up."
＃Souko
"...You're right."
Souko-san began to climb the stairs.
I followed after her.
Souko-san knocked on the door.
＃Souko
"...There's no response."
When she turned the knob, the door opened with startling ease.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san...?"
Shion-san was slumped over the bed.
＃Souko
"No way—"
Souko-san rushed to Shion-san's side.
No way—
＃Protagonist
"...Souko-san."
Souko-san turned toward me and silently shook her head.
＃Protagonist
"You're... joking, right...?"
Shion-san didn't move a muscle.
＃Protagonist
"Why... how could this...!?"
I approached Shion-san.
...She wasn't breathing.
＃Souko
"...It looks like poison."
A cup was rolling on the floor.
＃Protagonist
"What... what do we do now?"
＃Souko
"Right... let's investigate, just in case. I'm sure something... has been left behind."
＃Protagonist
"And if we find nothing...?"
In response to my question, Souko-san let out a light sigh.
＃Souko
"...Then everything will likely be handled as Shion-san's suicide."
