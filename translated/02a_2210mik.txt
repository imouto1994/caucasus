I stepped out into the hallway and went to the room right next door.
#Protagonist
"Dr. Mikanagi, it's me."
The door opened, and Dr. Mikanagi stepped out into the hallway.
#Mikanagi
"What is it this time?"
#Protagonist
"Um, I'd like to prepare for an attack by the culprit here tonight..."
#Mikanagi
"An attack by the culprit...? Could such a thing happen?"
#Protagonist
"I don't know. But... I think the probability is high."
#Mikanagi
"Hmm... but in that case, wouldn't it be better to go to someone else's place instead of mine?"
#Protagonist
"There's a chance you'll be targeted too, Dr. Mikanagi."
#Mikanagi
"Even so... since we're in adjacent rooms, I'd notice if something happened, wouldn't I? I think it'd be fine if you just came over then."
#Protagonist
"...You have a point."
That's certainly true.
There's no need to intentionally be in the same room.
#Mikanagi
"Well, I'm going to bed soon, so see you tomorrow."
#Protagonist
"Yeah... good night."
#Protagonist
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
