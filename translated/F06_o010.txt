「...There's a high probability Rokuyou-san was killed at that time.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Maya
「...Was Isamu-san killed around then...?」
＃Protagonist
「It's possible.」
＃Ai
「Isamu-san was likely killed during the night...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Benio
「...It was late at night. If Rokuyou was killed then, most people have no alibi...」
＃Protagonist
「That's true...」
＃Shion
「Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「...If I had taken your words to heart and checked properly at that time, we might not have fallen into such chaos...」
＃Protagonist
「That might be true, but...」
＃Takamine
「...The walls here are thick. You wouldn't hear much across the corridor.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「...I expect yours was the only room where it could be heard. Isamu's room was directly below.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「...But why did the culprit cut his throat... even at the cost of making such a loud noise...?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Narumi
「To think that was the sound of a throat being cut...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
