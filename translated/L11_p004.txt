"...Benio seems strangely lively, even though she was attacked herself."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"The possibility of me being the killer? I won't say it's nonexistent, but I was resting in the infirmary the whole time, wasn't I?"
#Satoshi
"That's true..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Benio was resting in her room even before Mistress Kirihara's body was discovered. I do not believe she had recovered yet."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I don't think Benio-kun is the culprit... but weren't you right there with her?"
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Mikanagi
"...I don't care what you two get up to, really, but I'd appreciate it if you kept it out of my workspace."
#Satoshi
"I-I'm not sure what you mean..."
#Narumi
"There's almost no chance Lady Benio is the killer, right? She was asleep in the infirmary the whole time."
#Satoshi
"True..."
