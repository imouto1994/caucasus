＃Benio
"The possibility of me being the killer? I won't say it's nonexistent, but I was resting in the infirmary the whole time, wasn't I?"

"I don't think Benio-kun is the culprit... but weren't you right there with her?"
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Mikanagi
"...I don't care what you two get up to, really, but I'd appreciate it if you kept it out of my workspace."

＃Narumi
