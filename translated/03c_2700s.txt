「Mikanagi-sensei, do you have any idea when Shion-san passed away?」
＃Mikanagi
「Hard to say... I'd guess within the last hour, but I can't say for certain.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
Shion-san... why...
A painting hangs on the wall.
...It’s Tsujimura-san’s work.
The painting Tsujimura-san painted looked down upon Shion-san’s silent remains.
A glass is rolling on the floor.

「...Is this how she drank the poison?」
＃Benio
「Better not touch it carelessly. There might be fingerprints left on it.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah, I understand.」
I take out a handkerchief, carefully wrap it, and pick it up.
＃Protagonist
「...There's a little bit of liquid left inside.」
＃Mikanagi
「Let me see it.」
I hand the glass to Mikanagi-sensei.
＃Mikanagi
「Don't sniff it carelessly. If it's cyanide like I suspect, even the gas alone could be fatal.」
＃Protagonist
「...Understood.」
How did it come to this...
The snow seems to be letting up.
Tomorrow will probably be clear, but this mansion...
The snow is getting weaker.
