"Dr. Mikanagi, can you tell when Shion-san died?"
#Mikanagi
"I'm not sure... probably within the last hour, but I can't say for certain."
#Main Character
"I see..."
Shion-san... why...
Paintings are hanging on the wall.
...They're Tsujimura-san's paintings.
The artwork Tsujimura-san painted looked down upon Shion-san's silent remains.
#Main Character
"...We shouldn't touch this carelessly."
There are likely fingerprints on it.
#Souko
"I don't think it matters much... the contents of the cup are more important. We have to identify exactly what kind of poison it was."
#Main Character
"What did she drink...?"
#Souko
"A fast-acting poison, surely... but if it was something highly irritant, it would be difficult."
#Main Character
"Because she would have spat it out..."
#Souko
"It's not just that. The possibility of murder also drops significantly. No one would drink something they knew was poison."
#Main Character
"True... but the one who brought this medicine was Maya-san, wasn't it...?"
#Souko
"...Of course, there's a possibility that Maya-san killed Shion-san. That's exactly why we have to investigate carefully."
Souko-san picked up the cup using a handkerchief to avoid touching it directly.
#Souko
"A little bit of liquid remains. If the police analyze it, they'll be able to determine the ingredients."
#Main Character
"But then—"
#Souko
"I know. There must be more we can do right here."
How could this happen...
The snow seems to be weakening.
It'll likely be clear tomorrow, but this mansion...
The snow is letting up.
