I dashed up the stairs.
Turning toward the eastern corridor, I saw the figure of Souko-san with her back to me.
＃Protagonist
"Souko-san—!"
Souko-san, who was in front of the performance room, turned around.
＃Protagonist
"Um... Benio-san is..."
Souko-san silently pointed inside the room.
＃Protagonist
"You’re... joking, right...?"
The grand piano in front of me.
The figure of Benio-san lying face down upon it.
Only—once again, the head was missing.
＃Souko
"I wonder... why..."
Souko-san let the words slip.
Truly—why?
For Benio-san to be changed into such a state.
I merely stared blankly at Benio-san’s headless corpse.
＃Souko
"...I’ll go call Dr. Mikanagi."
Souko-san turned on her heel and left the performance room.
I couldn't move.
I just stood there blankly... until Souko-san and Dr. Mikanagi returned, staring at Benio-san’s headless corpse.
