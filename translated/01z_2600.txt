The sound of a lock turning echoed through the silent chapel.
The door opened slightly, and the light from the hallway spilled inside.
Someone had entered the chapel.
They moved toward the altar with stealthy footsteps, careful not to make a sound.
Reaching the casket on the altar, they gave the lid a light tap.
In response, the lid lifted just a fraction of an inch.
But it moved no further. With the strength of the young girl inside, the lid was simply too heavy to lift.
The lid was opened from the outside.
The girl slowly sat up and looked up at the person before her with a look of wonder.
She likely didn't understand why she had been woken.
The ritual was still ongoing.
The bride was meant to remain in the casket until dawn.
However, her groom had intruded upon the chapel, a place that should have been inviolable.
#Rokuyou
"—Hey."
#Shion
"Ro... Rokuyou-sama...? Why... isn't the ritual still supposed to be...?"
#Rokuyou
"I just couldn't wait."
He placed a hand on her shoulder as he spoke.
#Shion
"...!?"
Her body grew stiff with tension.
#Rokuyou
"You're going to be mine by tomorrow anyway. So what's the harm?"
#Shion
"No...!"
He thrust his hand inside her dress, grabbing her soft curves.
She tried to brush his arm away, but there was no strength in her arms.
#Rokuyou
"It's useless. Not with your strength."
He pinned her body down to the floor.
#Shion
"Augh...!"
#Rokuyou
"This is going to happen sooner or later anyway. So it's not so bad to start now, is it?"
He climbed on top of her and began to grope her body.
#Shion
"Stop... please stop..."
#Rokuyou
"Listen to you. You've already been violated by that man, haven't you?"
#Shion
"—!?"
#Rokuyou
"Did you really think no one knew about your relationship?"
#Shion
"Th-that's..."
#Rokuyou
"I'm the only one who knows for now. But I'm guessing it's only a matter of time, don't you think?"
He hiked up the skirt of her dress and let his fingers crawl along her inner thighs.
#Shion
"—"
#Rokuyou
"...If you don't do what I say, I'll spill everything."
#Shion
"That's..."
#Rokuyou
"Shut up."
She fell silent.
He groped her legs, her breasts, her stomach—his hands explored her entire body.
Her long hair became tangled around him.
#Rokuyou
"—!?"
In a split second, literally by a hair's breadth, he jumped back before her hair could wrap around his neck.
#Shion
"Ah—"
She remained frozen, both hands reached out in front of her.
#Rokuyou
"...Don't you dare mess with me."
She'd tried to strangle him with her hair.
For a moment, it had dug into his neck.
#Rokuyou
"You were planning to kill me, weren't you...?"
#Shion
"Eh...?"
She looked up at him with a look of wonder.
#Rokuyou
"Don't you play dumb with me!"
#Shion
"Augh!!"
He kicked her as she lay on the floor.
#Rokuyou
"...If that's how you want to play it, I don't mind at all. I'll just tell everyone the truth tomorrow..."
#Shion
"Ngh... p-please, anything but that..."
#Rokuyou
"I'll tell them, 'I'm a lewd woman who had a relationship with a servant.'"
#Shion
"Stop... please stop... I beg you..."
#Rokuyou
"You want me to stop? Then don't you ever dare go against what I say. Got it?"
#Shion
"Y-yes..."
