I returned to Tokyo and went back to our peaceful daily lives.
It was spring, just as the cherry blossoms were beginning to fall.
#???
"Um, excuse me..."
A voice called out to me on the street, and I stopped.
Turning around, I saw a petite woman in Western dress, looking down as she reached out a hand.
#Main Character
"Is something the matter...?"
#???
"Um... could you tell me how to get to Ochanomizu...?"
#Main Character
"Ochanomizu is that way. It's a bit far, though."
I pointed toward the north.
#???
"……If you wouldn't mind, um, could you guide me there...?"
#Main Character
"Eh... um... well, if it's just that much, I don't mind..."
#???
"Then——I would appreciate it."
#Main Character
"Yeah... me too."
#???
"............"
#Main Character
"……? Um, something wrong?"
#???
"……Why haven't you noticed?"
#Main Character
"Eh...?"
Her tone had changed completely.
That voice was——
#Main Character
"No way..."
#Benio
"I'm asking why you haven't noticed me!!"
#Main Character
"Be... Benio-san!?"
#Benio
"Honestly... are you an idiot?"
#Main Character
"Wait... what are you doing in Tokyo, Benio-san!?"
#Benio
"Nn, ah... I thought I'd try going to university. I couldn't exactly commute from that mountain depths, after all."
#Main Character
"But still... there's Morioka or Sendai, you know?"
#Benio
"Since I had the chance, I decided to choose the Red Gate."
#Main Character
"The Red Gate... isn't that the top academic institution in Japan!! How did you——"
#Benio
"There are no problems when it comes to me, you know? ……What, is it not the place where you're studying?"
#Main Character
"Of course not..."
#Benio
"Hmm... that's a problem, then——I was thinking of asking you to show me around..."
#Main Character
"……I can at least give you a tour of Tokyo, I guess."
#Benio
"I see, then I'll count on you."
#Main Character
"……Well, I suppose it's fine."
Suddenly, I heard the meow of a cat.
#Main Character
"Eh...?"
#Main Character
"Wait... Lovecraft?"
#Benio
"Ah, that's right. ……Love, you can come out now."
When Benio-san opened her bag, a familiar black cat peered out.
#Benio
"Sorry about that, Love. You wouldn't want to get kicked off the train, would you?"
#Main Character
"You brought her all the way here...?"
#Benio
"I couldn't exactly leave her in that mansion when I'm not there."
#Benio
"Speaking of which, I heard some big festival is being held this year?"
#Main Character
"You mean the Olympics?"
#Benio
"That's the one. What do they do?"
#Main Character
"Sports."
#Benio
"……Oh, so just a glorified field day."
#Main Character
"……Well, on a global scale, it's a pretty big deal, I think..."
#Benio
"Also... what about the Bullet Train? When can we ride it?"
#Main Character
"Bullet——the Shinkansen? That's in the autumn, too."
#Benio
"……How boring."
#Benio
"Hmm? What's wrong, Love? ……Ah, right. I heard there's a place near here where black mice appear——"
#Main Character
"There's no such strange place."
#Benio
"Oh, there isn't...? Tokyo is unexpectedly dull, then."
#Main Character
"What were you expecting...?"
#Benio
"Then how about that? Tokyo Tower is already built, right?"
#Main Character
"It was finished a long time ago. Do you want to go?"
#Benio
"Yes!"
With a strangely innocent nod, Benio-san pulled on my arm.
#Benio
"Let's go, quickly. Is it this way?"
#Main Character
"That way is Asakusa. It's the complete opposite direction!"
Honestly——
It looks like I won't have any time to be depressed for a while——
