I returned to Tokyo and went back to our peaceful daily lives.
It was spring, just as the cherry blossoms were beginning to fall.
＃???
"Um, excuse me..."
A voice called out to me on the street, and I stopped.
Turning around, I saw a petite woman in Western dress, looking down as she reached out a hand.
＃Protagonist
"Is something the matter...?"
＃???
"Um... could you tell me how to get to Ochanomizu...?"
＃Protagonist
"Ochanomizu is that way. It's a bit far, though."
I pointed toward the north.
＃???
"……If you wouldn't mind, um, could you guide me there...?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh... um... well, if it's just that much, I don't mind..."
＃???
"Then——I would appreciate it."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... me too."
＃???
"............"
＃Protagonist
"……? Um, something wrong?"
＃???
"……Why haven't you noticed?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh...?"
Her tone had changed completely.
That voice was——
＃Protagonist
"No way..."
＃Benio
"I'm asking why you haven't noticed me!!"
＃Protagonist
"Be... Benio-san!?"
＃Benio
"Honestly... are you an idiot?"
＃Protagonist
"Wait... what are you doing in Tokyo, Benio-san!?"
＃Benio
"Nn, ah... I thought I'd try going to university. I couldn't exactly commute from that mountain depths, after all."
＃Protagonist
"But still... there's Morioka or Sendai, you know?"
＃Benio
"Since I had the chance, I decided to choose the Red Gate."
＃Protagonist
"The Red Gate... isn't that the top academic institution in Japan!! How did you——"
＃Benio
"There are no problems when it comes to me, you know? ……What, is it not the place where you're studying?"
＃Protagonist
"Of course not..."
＃Benio
"Hmm... that's a problem, then——I was thinking of asking you to show me around..."
＃Protagonist
"……I can at least give you a tour of Tokyo, I guess."
＃Benio
"I see, then I'll count on you."
＃Protagonist
"……Well, I suppose it's fine."
Suddenly, I heard the meow of a cat.
＃Protagonist
"Eh...?"
＃Protagonist
"Wait... Lovecraft?"
＃Benio
"Ah, that's right. ……Love, you can come out now."
When Benio-san opened her bag, a familiar black cat peered out.
＃Benio
"Sorry about that, Love. You wouldn't want to get kicked off the train, would you?"
＃Protagonist
"You brought her all the way here...?"
＃Benio
"I couldn't exactly leave her in that mansion when I'm not there."
＃Benio
"Speaking of which, I heard some big festival is being held this year?"
＃Protagonist
"You mean the Olympics?"
＃Benio
"That's the one. What do they do?"
＃Protagonist
"Sports."
＃Benio
"……Oh, so just a glorified field day."
＃Protagonist
"……Well, on a global scale, it's a pretty big deal, I think..."
＃Benio
"Also... what about the Bullet Train? When can we ride it?"
＃Protagonist
"Bullet——the Shinkansen? That's in the autumn, too."
＃Benio
"……How boring."
＃Benio
"Hmm? What's wrong, Love? ……Ah, right. I heard there's a place near here where black mice appear——"
＃Protagonist
"There's no such strange place."
＃Benio
"Oh, there isn't...? Tokyo is unexpectedly dull, then."
＃Protagonist
"What were you expecting...?"
＃Benio
"Then how about that? Tokyo Tower is already built, right?"
＃Protagonist
"It was finished a long time ago. Do you want to go?"
＃Benio
"Yes!"
With a strangely innocent nod, Benio-san pulled on my arm.
＃Benio
"Let's go, quickly. Is it this way?"
＃Protagonist
"That way is Asakusa. It's the complete opposite direction!"
Honestly——
It looks like I won't have any time to be depressed for a while——
