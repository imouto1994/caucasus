"I wonder why Mikanagi-sensei was killed? He didn't have a direct connection to the Nanatsuki family… there must be some other reason for it…"
＃Protagonist
"That might be the case…"
＃Maya
"Now that Mikanagi-sensei is gone… what are we supposed to do from here on…?"
＃Protagonist
"…Please, try not to lose heart."
＃Ai
"Not Mikanagi-sensei too… why…?"
＃Protagonist
"Ai-san…"
＃Tsujimura
"To think that even Mikanagi-sensei would pass away… whatever shall we do now…?"
＃Protagonist
"You’re right…"
＃Takamine
"…I haven't the slightest clue as to why he was killed. Should we assume this has nothing to do with the inheritance dispute…?"
＃Protagonist
"Who knows…"
＃Akane
"Mikanagi-sensei… why…!"
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san…"
＃Narumi
"…With Mikanagi-sensei dead, there won’t be anyone to help us if something happens. Maybe that’s what the killer is after…"
＃Protagonist
"That’s a possibility…"
