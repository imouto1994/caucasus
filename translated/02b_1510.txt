#Satoshi
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
I set the plates of fried rice down in front of the four people in the dining room—Souko-san, Benio-san, Akane-san, and Tsujimura-san.
#Benio
"Did you perform a poison test?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Benio
"It's immediately after such an incident. Lawyer Takamine's argument is understandable."
Benio-san stared intently at the plate of fried rice.
#Benio
"Of course, I don't intend to suspect Narumi in the slightest, but wouldn't it be possible to slip in poison while she's away from the kitchen?"
#Satoshi
"If you start saying things like that... you won't be able to eat anything."
#Benio
"...I know."
#Souko
"I think the probability of poison being mixed in is low."
Souko-san spoke up.
#Satoshi
"Why is that?"
#Souko
"If you look at the victims—the way Rokuyou-san and Ai-san were killed—they were killed when they were alone. I don't feel like the culprit would use a method that targets an unspecified large number of people."
#Benio
"Hmm—so if they're going to kill, they'll do it for certain. True, if this food were poisoned and we all gathered and ate at once, the culprit would be in trouble."
#Souko
"In that case, they'd either find some reason not to eat, or use some other method of evasion."
#Benio
"...Besides, poisoning is too different an image from the murders so far."
Even though her sister, Ai-san, has been killed, Benio-san is grasping things calmly and objectively.
#Benio
"—That being said, I cannot definitively state that there is no poison in this."
#Souko
"...You're right."
#Satoshi
"...That's just up to the culprit's mood, after all."
#Tsujimura
"I... I shall perform the poison test."
Tsujimura-san suddenly said.
#Benio
"Tsujimura...?"
#Tsujimura
"I cannot allow Miss Benio or the guests to be placed in danger. I shall be the one—"
Tsujimura-san scooped up some fried rice with a soup spoon.
His hand was trembling slightly.
#Tsujimura
"E-Excuse me... mnh."
Tsujimura-san chewed the fried rice.
#Akane
"Ts-Tsujimura-san...?"
Akane-san timidly offered a glass filled with water.
#Tsujimura
"Mnh... mnh... haah..."
#Satoshi
"Are you alright...?"
Sweat was appearing on Tsujimura-san's forehead.
#Tsujimura
"Y-Yes..."
He answered in a trembling voice after drinking the water from the glass.
#Benio
"—He seems to be alright."
Benio-san, who had been watching Tsujimura-san for a while, made the decision.
#Benio
"Sorry about that, Tsujimura."
#Tsujimura
"No... this is about the only thing I can do..."
#Souko
"...Let's eat too."
We also began our meal.
#Souko
"...Mm, it's delicious."
Souko-san savored the food.
#Benio
"Well, her skills are certainly genuine."
#Akane
"Though, watching her while she was making it, you'd never imagine it would turn out like this."
#Narumi
"...I can hear you, you know."
Narumi-san emerged from the kitchen.
#Narumi
"Could you take some food to Madam and Shion-ojousama as well?"
#Satoshi
"Ah, understood."
I was handed three plates piled with fried rice.
For Maya-san, Shion-san, and Dr. Mikanagi, I assume.
#Satoshi
"What about Takamine-san's portion...?"
#Narumi
"There's no need to feed him."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
It seems she's still holding a grudge about what happened earlier.
Well... first I'll head to where Maya-san likely is, in the infirmary.
