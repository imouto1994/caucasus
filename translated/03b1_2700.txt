I stepped outside the mansion.
The snow had weakened considerably.
Once dawn breaks, the snow will stop, and we'll probably be able to fix the bridge and return home.
But I hated the idea of just handing everything over to the police and saying goodbye.
I'll end it—with my own hands.
The tower was shrouded in silence.
We were talking just a while ago, so I didn't think she'd be asleep yet, but...
＃Protagonist
"That's right—Maya-san."
Maya-san had visited here just as I was leaving.
She seemed to have brought medicine, but if my prediction was correct, Maya-san is the one in danger—
I dashed up the stairs in one breath.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san—!!"
Maya-san was not in the room.
Shion-san was lying on the bed alone.
＃Protagonist
"Eh... Shion-san...?"
Her condition was clearly strange.
She didn't look like she was simply sleeping at all.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san!?"
I rushed to her and shook her.
There was no response.
Her breathing... had also stopped.
＃Protagonist
"You're... joking, right...?"
Why.
Why Shion-san.
She was just talking to me a moment ago.
A cup was rolling on the floor.
This is...
I picked up the cup using a handkerchief to avoid touching it directly.
A small amount of liquid remained inside.
＃Protagonist
"Poison...?"
There wasn't a single external injury on Shion-san's remains.
In that case, the cause of death would likely be poisoning, but—
Was it the medicine Maya-san brought?
Or did... Shion-san take the poison herself?
I have no way of judging that.
Until now, I thought there was a high possibility that Shion-san was the culprit.
So she committed suicide, tormented by the pangs of conscience.
Thinking of it that way is simple.
But if this was a murder—
Is the culprit Maya-san?
Or someone else entirely?
Maybe I should gather everyone and hear what they have to say.
...First, I'll consult with Tsujimura-san.
All alone, there's nothing more I can do...
