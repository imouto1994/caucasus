By the time I’d put on my winter gear and returned to the entrance, Takamine-san was already prepared and waiting.
#Protagonist
"Sorry to keep you waiting."
#Takamine
"It’s still a blizzard out there. Make sure you don't get separated."
#Protagonist
"Yes, I understand."
#Takamine
"Let's go."
Takamine-san opened the door.
Outside was a raging storm.
#Protagonist
"Whoa..."
Snow lashed against my face.
Visibility was almost zero.
A violent world of white.
The snow was already up to my knees.
#Takamine
"This way. Follow me."
Takamine-san took the lead.
I followed behind him as he kicked through the drifts.
After walking through the wind and snow for a while, Takamine-san suddenly stopped.
#Takamine
"Dammit..."
#Protagonist
"Is something wrong?"
#Takamine
"...Look."
Takamine-san pointed ahead.
Before us lay a cliff where the wind howled as it tore through the gap.
#Protagonist
"The suspension bridge... it’s gone...?"
#Takamine
"...It certainly appears that way."
Takamine-san pushed through the snow to reach the remaining wooden posts.
A rope hung limply from one of them.
#Takamine
"...It’s been cut."
#Protagonist
"What... Then..."
#Takamine
"Someone dropped the bridge on purpose. ...Dammit, the phone line was cut here, too."
Takamine-san slammed his fist against the post.
#Protagonist
"Is there no other way?"
#Takamine
"...If it weren't for the snow, we could climb down into the ravine and walk across, but... in this weather, it’s impossible."
Takamine-san turned around.
#Takamine
"We’re going back. There’s no point in staying here."
#Protagonist
"R... right."
We retraced our steps.
#Protagonist
"What are we going to do now?"
#Takamine
"We have no choice but to wait for rescue. A deliveryman comes by every few days; someone will notice then."
#Protagonist
"But... you know, with what happened to Rokuyou-san..."
#Takamine
"Did you see Rokuyou-kun?"
#Protagonist
"Only for a moment..."
#Takamine
"...I see. Benio-kun only said he’d been 'murdered,' but was it that obvious?"
#Protagonist
"...Yes."
His head was missing, after all.
At the very least, there was a killer out there who had decapitated him.
#Takamine
"Hmm..."
Giving a short nod, Takamine-san fell silent.
We walked back to the mansion entrance in silence.
