The snow had weakened considerably.
Though the starlight was not yet visible, the clouds appeared to have thinned significantly.
We entered the tower.
#Benio
"It's not locked."
Benio-san said, looking at the door we’d just entered.
#Mikanagi
"I told her to keep it locked, but..."
#Protagonist
"I'm a bit concerned... let's go."
I led the way up the stairs.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san, it's me. Are you awake...?"
I waited for a moment, but there was no response from inside.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san—?"
#Benio
"Step aside."
Benio-san swapped places with me and turned the doorknob.
#Benio
"It's open... Shion!"
I followed Benio-san into the room.
Shion-san was slumped over the bed.
#Protagonist
"Shion-san...?"
Benio-san rushed to Shion-san's side before I could.
#Benio
"Shion! ...Doctor, come here."
#Mikanagi
"Shion-san... this is—"
#Protagonist
"W-What is it...?"
#Benio
"...She's dead."
Benio-san shook her head.
#Protagonist
"Why... how..."
#Mikanagi
"...Most likely potassium cyanide. Poison."
#Protagonist
"Poison...?"
#Benio
"...Can you tell if it was suicide or murder?"
#Mikanagi
"As for that... it’s hard to make someone drink cyanide without them noticing, so there's a possibility of suicide, but..."
#Protagonist
"...Let's find some proof. Whether it was suicide or murder, something must have been left behind."
#Benio
"...Right."
