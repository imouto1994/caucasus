「As I thought, Shion-san was targeted too... but it didn't end in murder... something's fishy.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Souko
「...There's a very real possibility Shion-san will be targeted next. She needs to be careful...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「To think Shion would be targeted as well...」
＃Protagonist
「Her life isn't in danger, so don't worry.」
＃Maya
「Shion is still safe, isn't she...?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes... no need to worry.」
＃Ai
「Why Shion too... why...?」
＃Protagonist
「...We don't know that yet.」
＃Ai
「I'm glad I was the one targeted... if it had been Shion...」
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...」
＃Benio
「...I understand that Shion could be targeted. However... something feels off...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Shion, huh... she likely feels some sense of debt for being an adopted child. That’s why she never complains about her situation...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「So even Lady Shion is not safe...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Tsujimura
「...Lady Shion seems quite despondent...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「...Shion-kun is safe, I assume?」
＃Protagonist
「Y-Yeah...」
＃Takamine
「It seems Shion-kun has returned to her room. It’s best for her to stay put for now.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Mikanagi
「...It was my mistake for not properly checking the medicine. If I had verified it this morning, this could have been avoided...」
＃Protagonist
「Perhaps...」
＃Mikanagi
「I expect Shion-san is in her room.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
