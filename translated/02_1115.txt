"So the killer remains a mystery after all..."
Souko-san muttered to herself.
＃Protagonist
"It seems so..."
＃Souko
"We should probably re-examine everything and try to narrow down our list of suspects to some extent."
＃Protagonist
"Will that really help anything?"
＃Souko
"...Think about it. The suspension bridge was cut, wasn't it? If the phone lines were severed to delay us from reporting the crime... then there’s a high possibility this isn't over yet."
＃Protagonist
"No... but why? For what purpose...?"
＃Souko
"How should I know? I'm simply discussing the possibilities."
＃Protagonist
"...Are you saying Rokuyou-san’s murder was just a precursor for something else?"
＃Souko
"It's just a possibility."
Souko-san stood up.
＃Souko
"As long as a killer is still loose in this house, we can't afford to let our guard down. I’ll make sure to warn everyone else about this."
＃Protagonist
"Right. Please do."
＃Souko
"And you, make sure you stay alert. The thing a killer fears most is the person who's trying to unmask them."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... I’ll keep that in mind."
Souko-san left the room.
What should I do now...?
Should I follow Souko-san’s lead and go around warning the others?
Or should I just stay put in my room?
[Patrol the mansion]
[Stay in the room]
I’ll go on a patrol.
I don't know if it’ll change anything, but it’s certainly better than doing nothing.
I stood up and stepped out of the room.
I have no idea what might happen next.
I should probably wait here in my room for now.
The killer surely knows we're investigating, so I can't rule out the possibility of them coming for me.
I walked over to the door and turned the lock.
I’ll just wait and see how things develop for a while.
...Though I have no idea just how long "a while" will be.
