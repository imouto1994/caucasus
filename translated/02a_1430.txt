We returned to the others, who had been standing a short distance away.
Everyone seemed to be keeping their distance from one another.
The number of victims had increased, and the killer might be right here among them.
It was only natural that paranoia was starting to set in.
#Akane
"What do you intend to do now...?"
Akane-san asked with a look of dread on her face.
#Protagonist
"Well..."
I stole a glance at Souko-san.
#Souko
"If possible, I’d like everyone to avoid acting alone..."
Souko-san was sounding a bit hesitant.
#Benio
"—In other words, you want us to keep an eye on each other."
#Souko
"..."
Souko-san shot a sharp look at Benio-san for a moment.
#Souko
"...I suppose it’s only natural for you to see it that way. I simply thought it was the best way to ensure everyone's safety..."
#Takamine
"I refuse."
Takamine-san, who had been standing alone by the window, finally spoke up.
#Takamine
"Acting in a group with someone who might be a murderer is practically begging to be killed."
#Protagonist
"Takamine-san..."
#Takamine
"If we aren't going to stay together in a large group like this, I'd much rather be alone in my room where I can feel at ease."
That... was a fair point, actually.
#Narumi
"And we have our jobs to do, you know? We can't have someone hovering over us twenty-four hours a day."
#Akane
"She's right... but that’s exactly why we can't just lock ourselves in our rooms either..."
Narumi-san and Akane-san both agreed with Takamine-san.
#Benio
"The same goes for Tsujimura, I imagine."
#Tsujimura
"Yes... I intend to stay in the office... but I have Shion-ojousama to look after as well..."
#Souko
"...Then I suppose we have no choice but to let everyone look out for themselves."
#Protagonist
"...I guess so."
But... in the midst of such an extraordinary situation.
Why were they so determined to maintain their daily routines?
Setting aside Takamine-san, Narumi-san, Akane-san, and even Tsujimura-san seemed to be prioritizing their work above all else.
I couldn't quite wrap my head around it.
#Benio
"...I'm hungry."
Benio-san muttered suddenly.
#Narumi
"I've got everything ready, if you're interested."
#Benio
"Let's get some food in our bellies first. After that, everyone can do as they please."
#Takamine
"Fine by me. I'll be doing exactly that."
Takamine-san was the first to move.
#Takamine
"—I refuse to eat anything when I don't know what might be in it."
#Narumi
"Hey—!? What the hell is that supposed to mean!?"
#Takamine
"I'm not a big enough man to eat something prepared by someone else in this situation without a shred of doubt. You'd be wise to pass on it too, Benio-kun."
#Benio
"Thanks for the advice."
Benio-san tossed the words back at him sarcastically.
#Takamine
"I'm going back to my room."
Takamine-san stepped out of the Great Hall.
No one moved to stop him.
#Souko
"...Shall we head to the dining hall?"
At Souko-san’s words, everyone finally began to file out of the room.
