"Ai-san's cause of death was asphyxiation due to neck compression. Mikanagi-sensei mentioned that blunt-force contusions are visible on the back of her head..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Benio
"I wonder if my sister suffered as she died... If she had lost consciousness first, perhaps it was a little easier for her..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Tsujimura
"Lady Ai... How tragic..."
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Takamine
"To think even Ai-kun would be killed... Just what on earth is happening here?"
#Satoshi
"Yeah..."
#Akane
"Lady Ai... Why did it come to this...?"
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Narumi
"...The fact that Lady Ai was murdered might mean that no one is safe... except for the killer."
#Satoshi
"Maybe so..."
