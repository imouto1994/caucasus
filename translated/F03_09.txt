I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
＃Narumi
"Oh, what's up?"
Narumi-san was there.
＃Protagonist
"Are you preparing lunch?"
＃Narumi
"Yeah, are you hungry?"
＃Protagonist
"Not quite yet."
＃Narumi
"I'll have it ready so we can eat a bit after one."
＃Protagonist
"Understood."
＃Narumi
"So, didn't you have some kind of business with me?"
＃Protagonist
"Um..."
I’ve arrived at the kitchen again.
＃Narumi
"Oh, do you need something else?"
＃Protagonist
"Um..."
I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
...But no one is here.
What should I do...?
Narumi-san was in the kitchen.
＃Narumi
"Oh, Akane, what's wrong?"
＃Akane
"Narumi-san, have you seen Lady Ai?"
＃Narumi
"Lady Ai...? No, I haven't."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
It seems she hasn't come here either.
＃Akane
"Let's look somewhere else."
＃Protagonist
"...Alright."
We decided to go somewhere else.
Narumi-san was in the kitchen.
＃Narumi
"Oh, still haven't found Lady Ai?"
＃Protagonist
"No... that's right."
＃Akane
"There should only be so many places she could go inside the manor..."
＃Narumi
"Maybe you should try looking more thoroughly?"
＃Protagonist
"...I suppose so."
We decided to go search elsewhere.
I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
＃Akane
"Narumi-san isn't here."
There's no one inside.
Of course, that includes Ai-san.
＃Protagonist
"She wouldn't be... hiding somewhere, right?"
＃Akane
"I don't think so."
Akane-san opens the service entrance leading to the back to check.
Snow immediately blows inside.
＃Akane
"It's drifting quite a bit, but I don't see any footprints..."
＃Protagonist
"Let's look elsewhere."
We decided to go to another location.
