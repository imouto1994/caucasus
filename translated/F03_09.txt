I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
#なるみ
"Oh, what's up?"
Narumi-san was there.
#Protagonist
"Are you preparing lunch?"
#なるみ
"Yeah, are you hungry?"
#Protagonist
"Not quite yet."
#なるみ
"I'll have it ready so we can eat a bit after one."
#Protagonist
"Understood."
#なるみ
"So, didn't you have some kind of business with me?"
#Protagonist
"Um..."
I’ve arrived at the kitchen again.
#なるみ
"Oh, do you need something else?"
#Protagonist
"Um..."
I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
...But no one is here.
What should I do...?
Narumi-san was in the kitchen.
#なるみ
"Oh, Akane, what's wrong?"
#Akane
"Narumi-san, have you seen Lady Ai?"
#なるみ
"Lady Ai...? No, I haven't."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
It seems she hasn't come here either.
#Akane
"Let's look somewhere else."
#Protagonist
"...Alright."
We decided to go somewhere else.
Narumi-san was in the kitchen.
#なるみ
"Oh, still haven't found Lady Ai?"
#Protagonist
"No... that's right."
#Akane
"There should only be so many places she could go inside the manor..."
#なるみ
"Maybe you should try looking more thoroughly?"
#Protagonist
"...I suppose so."
We decided to go search elsewhere.
I’ve arrived at the kitchen.
#Akane
"Narumi-san isn't here."
There's no one inside.
Of course, that includes Ai-san.
#Protagonist
"She wouldn't be... hiding somewhere, right?"
#Akane
"I don't think so."
Akane-san opens the service entrance leading to the back to check.
Snow immediately blows inside.
#Akane
"It's drifting quite a bit, but I don't see any footprints..."
#Protagonist
"Let's look elsewhere."
We decided to go to another location.
