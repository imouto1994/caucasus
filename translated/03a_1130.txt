When I stepped into the corridor, Tsujimura-san was coming out of Akane-san’s room, which was directly opposite.
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, how is Akane-san?"
#Tsujimura
"...I don't think there's any cause for concern. But..."
Tsujimura-san looked at the mangled kitchen door.
#Tsujimura
"Why did such an explosion..."
#Protagonist
"Souko-san thinks it might have been a gas explosion."
#Tsujimura
"Was there a gas leak...?"
#Protagonist
"...Or someone intentionally opened the gas valve."
In this case, "someone" obviously meant the culprit.
#Tsujimura
"Sigh... I'll go and explain it to the others."
Tsujimura-san walked off sluggishly.
He looks exhausted...
I pulled myself together and knocked on Akane-san’s door.
#Protagonist
"Excuse me."
Inside the room, Akane-san was being treated by Dr. Mikanagi.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san, are you okay?"
#Akane
"Yes. It was a bit hot, but I'm okay."
Akane-san moved her hand, which had ointment applied to it.
#Mikanagi
"Don't move it too much yet."
#Akane
"Ye... yes!"
Akane-san stopped moving immediately.
#Protagonist
"What on earth happened...?"
#Akane
"Um... I was about to go into the kitchen and put my hand on the door... then there was a zap... and the door went boom..."
Whether it was because she was shaken or if she was always like this, Akane-san began explaining with gestures.
#Mikanagi
"Static electricity, maybe?"
#Akane
"Ah... y-yes, I think so."
Akane-san nodded at Dr. Mikanagi's words.
#Protagonist
"Did a spark from static electricity ignite the gas...?"
#Mikanagi
"Static electricity is common in winter, so that might be it."
Dr. Mikanagi stood up and placed his hand on Akane-san’s shoulder.
#Mikanagi
"In any case, please rest for a while."
#Akane
"Ye... yes!"
#Mikanagi
"Well then, I'll leave the rest to you."
Dr. Mikanagi left the room.
#Protagonist
"Um..."
I looked at Akane-san.
Akane-san was staring blankly at the door Dr. Mikanagi had left through.
#Protagonist
"...Akane-san?"
She didn't respond at all.
#Protagonist
"Um, Akane-san... is your head okay?"
#Akane
"—!? That's mean! I might be an idiot, but you don't have to worry about me *that* much, do you!?"
#Protagonist
"No, that's not it! I heard you hit your head in the explosion...!"
I hurriedly tried to explain.
Well, I suppose it was my fault for putting it in a way that could be misunderstood.
#Akane
"Whoa...! Please forget what I just said!"
Akane-san waved her hands around and lunged at me.
#Protagonist
"Akane-san, didn't Dr. Mikanagi tell you to rest?"
#Akane
"Ah..."
#Protagonist
"See... your bandage is coming undone."
I took Akane-san’s hand and began re-wrapping the bandage.
Her skin, which I caught a glimpse of, was a bit red, but it didn't look like a major burn.
#Akane
"S-Sorry... to make you do even this..."
#Protagonist
"It's fine."
Her hand was trembling slightly while I re-wrapped the bandage.
#Protagonist
"...Are you okay?"
#Akane
"Eh, yes..."
...She must be scared, after all.
I haven't told Akane-san yet that this accident might have been intentional... but it's no wonder she's anxious.
#Protagonist
"I'm going to go check on the kitchen, so I'll call Narumi-san to come and look after you."
#Akane
"Ah, okay."
Akane-san nodded.
#Protagonist
"See you later, then."
#Akane
"Yes, thank you very much."
With Akane-san seeing me off, I left her room.
#Akane
"Um... it really wasn't just an accident, was it...?"
#Protagonist
"...I don't know yet. Souko-san is looking into it now..."
#Akane
"Was I... being targeted...?"
#Protagonist
"...I don't know that either. After all, there's no reason for the culprit to target you, is there?"
#Akane
"Yes... I suppose so... but..."
#Protagonist
"Akane-san..."
I gently squeezed her hand over the re-wrapped bandage.
#Akane
"Ah..."
#Protagonist
"It's okay. I'll protect you, Akane-san."
With that, I gently embraced her.
