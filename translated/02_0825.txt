#Benio
"I’ll go inform the others."
With that, Benio-san ran down the hallway.
#Souko
"Are you sure we should open it?"
Still holding the key, Souko-san asked Tsujimura-san.
#Tsujimura
"...We have no choice. This is an emergency."
Souko-san inserted the key.
The door opened.
The chapel was deathly silent.
The casket on the dais remained exactly as it had been placed yesterday.
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama."
Tsujimura-san called out toward the casket.
There was no response from within.
#Tsujimura
"Ojousama... please, excuse me."
Tsujimura-san placed his hand on the lid of the casket.
Inside, Shion-san was lying perfectly still, her eyes closed.
She looked almost like—
#Tsujimura
"Ojousama, Shion-ojousama!"
#Shion
"Nn..."
Her long eyelashes fluttered.
—She was alive.
For some reason, that was the only thought in my head.
#Shion
"Nn... Seiji-san...?"
#Tsujimura
"Are you awake, Shion-ojousama?"
#Shion
"Um... what happened...?"
Shion-san looked up at Tsujimura-san's face in a daze.
Suddenly, her gaze shifted toward me.
#Shion
"You are..."
#Protagonist
"Are you alright?"
#Shion
"Ye... yes...?"
She didn't seem to realize what was going on; she just tilted her head.
#Shion
"Um... where is Rokuyou-sama...?"
#Protagonist
"Well..."
#Tsujimura
"Shion-ojousama, let’s get you out of there first."
Cutting me off, Tsujimura-san helped Shion-san up.
#Shion
"Oh..."
Shion-san climbed out of the casket.
She was wearing the same pure white dress as yesterday.
Her hair was a bit messy from sleep.
#Shion
"Ah..."
As she stood up, Shion-san stumbled and leaned against me for support.
#Protagonist
"A-are you okay?"
#Shion
"M-my apologies..."
Shion-san quickly pulled away.
#Tsujimura
"Let's go to the infirmary... no, let's get you settled in the spare room next door for now."
#Shion
"Alright..."
