I’ve come to Benio-san's room.
I wonder if she's inside.
#Akane
"Lady Benio, it's Hiyama."
Akane-san knocks on the door, but there's no response from inside.
#Protagonist
"Is she not here...?"
#Akane
"...It seems so."
#Protagonist
"Then let's head elsewhere. We don't have time to waste."
#Akane
"Yes... you're right."
We decided to head for another location.
I’ve come to Benio-san's room.
I wonder if she's inside.
#Akane
"Lady Benio, it's Hiyama."
Akane-san knocks on the door.
#Benio
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Benio-san, have you seen Ai-san?"
#Benio
"Sister? ...No, I haven't."
#Akane
"She hasn't been seen for a while now."
#Benio
"Hmm... I wonder what she's up to."
#Protagonist
"Please let us know if you see her."
#Benio
"Yeah, I got it."
We decided to search elsewhere.
#Benio
"What is it? Still haven't found my sister?"
#Protagonist
"No..."
#Benio
"Hmm... I don't really keep track of her movements..."
#Akane
"We'll try searching a few more places."
#Benio
"Alright."
We decided to head elsewhere.
