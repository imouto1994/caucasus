I arrived at Souko-san's room.
I knocked on the door and waited for a while.
The door opened, and Souko-san peeked her face out.
#Souko
"Oh, what brings you here at this hour?"
#Satoshi
"Um... Souko-san, is it alright if I stay in this room tonight?"
#Souko
"...Huh?"
Souko-san blinked in surprise.
#Satoshi
"Ah, no, I don't mean anything weird by it, it's just that things are dangerous, so I thought maybe I could protect you if we were together."
I offered a faltering excuse.
#Souko
"Hah... look, there's no point in protecting someone like me, is there?"
Souko-san murmured as if exasperated.
#Satoshi
"B-But... in this situation, we don't know who'll be targeted next, you know?"
#Souko
"At the very least, you and I aren't going to be targeted. We're outsiders, aren't we?"
#Satoshi
"I wonder..."
I felt a trace of anxiety, but having been told that by Souko-san, I had no words to offer in return.
#Souko
"...It's frustrating, but right now, all we can do is wait. Let's pray that there aren't any more victims."
#Satoshi
"...I understand."
I guess all I can do is endure tonight...
#Satoshi
"Well then, Souko-san, good night. ...Excuse me."
#Souko
"Yeah, good night."
