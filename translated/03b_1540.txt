Returning to the first floor, I stood before the kitchen.
I wanted to investigate why this place had been targeted.
I stepped into the soot-stained kitchen.
What was the point of making this place unusable?
＃???
「What are you doing?」
Turning at the voice, I saw Souko-san peering in from the entrance.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san... No, I just thought I'd investigate this place a bit more...」
＃Souko
「Investigate, huh...?」
Entering the room, Souko-san scanned the interior.
＃Souko
「There’s no doubt the culprit set a trap to trigger the explosion intentionally...」
＃Protagonist
「We can assume it was designed to blow up when someone tried to open the door, right?」
＃Souko
「Likely. There were traces of that kind of mechanism.」
＃Protagonist
「In that case, the probability of whoever opened the door getting injured was high. But... it wasn't guaranteed who would open it.」
＃Souko
「The most likely person would have been Narumi-san... but the one who got hurt was Akane-san.」
＃Protagonist
「It must have been pure coincidence...」
＃Souko
「True. There’s no reason for those two to be targeted. So it’s natural to assume the place itself was the target.」
＃Protagonist
「Exactly...」
However, there was no evidence to prove exactly why the kitchen was targeted.
Souko-san walked over to the wall and tried to pry open the oven lid.
＃Souko
「Maybe it warped from the blast... Hrrgh.」
No matter how hard she pulled, the oven lid wouldn't budge an inch.
＃Souko
「This looks unusable now, too.」
＃Protagonist
「...I wonder about the outside.」
I wondered if the side entrance had any connection.
＃Protagonist
「Maybe to block off an exit, or something like?」
＃Souko
「With this snow, it doesn't look like anyone's going anywhere regardless.」
＃Protagonist
「But there are other places to go in and out...」
The more I thought about it, the more confused I became.
＃Protagonist
「...What do you think, Souko-san?」
＃Souko
「The reason for the explosion... as you mentioned, it might be a scorched-earth tactic.」
＃Protagonist
「But the culprit is also in this mansion, so it would make things difficult for them as well, wouldn't it?」
＃Souko
「The goal isn't to starve everyone. Being trapped like this, if the food runs out, everyone will inevitably lose their cool, right?」
＃Protagonist
「To rob us of our calm judgment...?」
＃Souko
「...The fact that you realized that means you’re still keeping your head.」
Souko-san patted my shoulder and smiled.
