I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Benio-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Benio-san appears.
#Benio
"What is it? Did something happen?"
#Protagonist
"Souko-san is missing."
#Benio
"What...? You mean she's nowhere to be found?"
#Protagonist
"Yeah... her room was ransacked, and she's nowhere in sight..."
#Benio
"...There aren't that many places in this mansion where one could hide."
Benio-san murmurs with her arms crossed.
#Benio
"Tsujimura likely manages the keys strictly, so she couldn't enter rooms that were locked to begin with. I think she'll be found if we search the house, but..."
#Protagonist
"But... Akane-san hasn't been found yet either, you know?"
#Benio
"I know. It's only natural to think the two disappearances share the same cause, but..."
#Protagonist
"...I'll try looking a bit more."
#Benio
"I'll go too."
#Protagonist
"No. You're still recovering, aren't you?"
#Benio
"But...! ...Fine. I'll behave myself for a while."
#Protagonist
"Please do. Well, see you later."
#Benio
"Ah... hey!"
#Protagonist
"What is it?"
#Benio
"...Be careful."
#Protagonist
"Yeah. Of course."
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I wonder if she's in her room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Benio-san, it's me."
The door opens, and Benio-san appears.
#Benio
"Did you find her?"
#Protagonist
"No... neither Souko-san nor Akane-san yet..."
#Benio
"I see..."
#Protagonist
"I'll try looking a bit more."
#Benio
"Yeah, understood."
I've come to Benio-san's room on the second floor.
I don't have any business here anymore, but...
#Protagonist
"...I'll go somewhere else."
I offered a silent prayer toward the door for a moment before moving on.
