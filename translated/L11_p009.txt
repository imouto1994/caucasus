"I don't know where Akane-san went..."

"I see..."

"True..."
#Tsujimura
"Since when exactly has she been missing...?"

"True..."

"There is a possibility that she is the one in the fire... but I cannot make that judgment."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"...Of course, there is a possibility the body is Akane-san's. But for now... I'm focusing on the outcome that seems even slightly more likely."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"...Akane is gone, but that girl has no reason to kill Kirihara-san. I believe in her."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
