「If you search for information on Nanatsuki Village, it's a story that comes up right away. Though I couldn't find any documents that go into great detail.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Maya
「...I am aware that such rumors are circulating in the village. However, I do not know the specifics.」
＃Protagonist
「...I see.」

「...I would prefer not to answer that question.」
＃Protagonist
「I see... sorry about that.」
＃Benio
「The 'Curse of the Seven Possessions', huh... well, I don't mind. First, 'Item One: The fact that all heads of the Nanatsuki family have died mysterious deaths.' 'Item Two: The fact that no males are ever born into the Nanatsuki family.'」
＃Benio
「 'Item Three: The mysterious disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Item Four: The fact that the mansion is painted entirely in jet black.' 'Item Five: The way massive numbers of crows cover the mansion.'」
＃Benio
「 'Item Six: The matter of the "Sacrifice of the Seven Possessions".' 'Item Seven: The ghost of the girl who was made a sacrifice wandering the mansion.' ...That’s all of them.」
＃Protagonist
「Geez... thank you.」
＃Tsujimura

＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「A-a curse...? I know people say all sorts of things about it... but it’s quite scary, isn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Narumi
「A curse? I’ve heard they say a lot of things in town... but if you want details, why don't you try asking Lady Benio?」
＃Protagonist
「Good point.」
