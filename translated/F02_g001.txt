"The 'Curse of the Seven Possessions', huh... well, I don't mind. First, 'Item One: The fact that all heads of the Nanatsuki family have died mysterious deaths.' 'Item Two: The fact that no males are ever born into the Nanatsuki family.'"

" 'Item Three: The mysterious disappearances in Nanatsuki Village.' 'Item Four: The fact that the mansion is painted entirely in jet black.' 'Item Five: The way massive numbers of crows cover the mansion.'"

" 'Item Six: The matter of the "Sacrifice of the Seven Possessions".' 'Item Seven: The ghost of the girl who was made a sacrifice wandering the mansion.' ...That’s all of them."

#Protagonist
"Good point."
