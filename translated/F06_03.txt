There was no one in the grand hall.
Now... what should I do?
Takamine-san was in the grand hall, drinking coffee alone.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Takamine-san.」
＃Takamine
「What is it...?」
He glared up at me with a sharp gaze.
＃Protagonist
「Um...」
As I entered the grand hall, I locked eyes with Takamine-san.
＃Takamine
「...What do you want?」
Takamine-san and Dr. Mikanagi were in the grand hall.
＃Mikanagi
「Hey, what's the matter?」
He asked me while holding a coffee cup in one hand.
＃Protagonist
「Well...」
