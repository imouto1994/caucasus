I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
「Oh, it's you. What is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Do you have a moment?」
＃Souko
「Yes, of course.」
With that, Souko-san guided me into the room.
＃Souko
「So, what's your business?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve come to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
「Oh, it's you again. What's the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Could I talk to you for a moment?」
＃Souko
「Yes, of course.」
With that, Souko-san guided me into the room.
＃Souko
「What is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
I wait for a while, but there was no response from inside.
Is she not here?
I gave up and decided to head elsewhere.
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
「Oh, it's you. What is it? And Akane-san is with you too.」
＃Akane
「Um, have you seen Lady Ai?」
＃Souko
「Ai-san? No, I haven't.」
Souko-san shakes her head.
＃Protagonist
「It seems she hasn't been seen for a while now.」
＃Souko
「I see... I’m worried, especially after what happened...」
＃Akane
「Please let us know if you see her. We'll be looking around the other areas.」
＃Souko
「Yes, I understand.」
＃Protagonist
「Well then, we'll be going.」
＃Akane
「Please excuse us.」
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
「...Oh, it's you two. Have you found her yet?」
＃Akane
「No...」
＃Souko
「I think I'll try looking around a few other places myself.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, could you please?」
＃Souko
「Of course.」
＃Akane
「Then, we're counting on you.」
I’ve made it to Souko-san's room.

I wait for a while, but there was no response from inside.
＃Akane
「It seems she isn't here.」
＃Protagonist
「So it seems.」
I gave up and decided to head elsewhere.
