We returned to Tokyo and went back to our peaceful daily lives.
It was autumn, and I was walking down a moonlit path when a familiar person appeared before me.
#Main Character
"Eh...?"
#???
"……Whoops."
#Main Character
"Narumi-san... right?"
#Narumi
"……M-might you have the wrong person?"
#Main Character
"……No, you're definitely Narumi-san. What are you doing?"
#Narumi
"I... I'm working."
#Main Character
"Working... you mean as a thief?"
#Narumi
"Shhh! You're being too loud!"
Narumi-san pulled on my sleeve and led me to the edge of the path.
#Narumi
"……I wouldn't be a thief dressed like this."
#Main Character
"But still... you're likely infiltrating some inn or something, aren't you? Just like at the Nanatsuki mansion..."
#Narumi
"Ugh... well, yeah... I couldn't exactly make a decent profit there... hey, I've got an idea. Could you help me out for a bit?"
#Main Character
"Eh... no thanks."
#Narumi
"Don't be like that. We've survived death together, haven't we?"
#Main Character
"That's completely different from this."
#Narumi
"So, the restaurant where I'm working now gets a lot of big shots from major corporations. The other day, a guy from a motorcycle company came in——"
Narumi-san started talking, ignoring my words.
#Narumi
"Apparently they're entering some kind of car race abroad, and I was thinking if there was some way I could steal the car they made for it."
#Main Character
"Don't be ridiculous... do you intend to go all the way abroad?"
#Narumi
"The thing is, there's a test car at a racetrack in Mie. Don't you think we could manage something with that?"
#Main Character
"No, I don't. Give it up."
#Narumi
"You're so mean... you could at least tag along for a bit."
#Main Character
"I want to live a stable life."
#Narumi
"Living life on a tightrope can be fun too, you know?"
#Main Character
"……Well, I suppose a little bit of that might——"
As soon as I muttered that, she grabbed my arm firmly.
#Narumi
"Alright, it's decided! We're heading to Tokyo Station then. It's just a short ride to Nagoya on the Shinkansen."
#Main Character
"W-wait, I didn't mean——!?"
#Narumi
"It'll be fine!"
And so, I was dragged away.
Good grief... I really do prefer a quiet life.
