"About Dr. Mikanagi? Hmm, he did treat my finger, but he feels a bit... flighty, I guess."
#Satoshi
"...I suppose so."
#Maya
"We were very much indebted to Dr. Mikanagi's father. I am only where I am today thanks to the Mikanagi family."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Ai
"Dr. Mikanagi often looks after us. Doctors won't come out to such a remote place, so it's a huge help."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Benio
"Are you asking about Hiroshi? He's been here since long ago, so we're practically like family."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Tsujimura
"Dr. Mikanagi is indispensable here. The Mistress and Lady Shion aren't in the best of health, after all..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Rokuyou
"Hiroshi and I have been stuck with each other for years, so I know a lot. Even back in med school, he seemed to be breaking plenty of hearts."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"Dr. Mikanagi appears to be an excellent physician. He specializes in internal medicine, but I'm sure he could handle simple surgeries if needed."
#Satoshi
"I see."
#Mikanagi
"Me? My father is the true family doctor for the Nanatsuki. But he's getting on in years, so I've been staying here lately."
#Satoshi
"Is that so?"
#Akane
"Eh, Dr. Mikanagi!? Um, well... wouldn't he be in the infirmary...?"
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Dr. Mikanagi? He has a bit of a light air about him. Though he hardly ever says a word to me."
#Satoshi
"I-I see..."
