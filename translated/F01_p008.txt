"About Dr. Mikanagi? Hmm, he did treat my finger, but he feels a bit... flighty, I guess."
＃Protagonist
"...I suppose so."
＃Maya
"We were very much indebted to Dr. Mikanagi's father. I am only where I am today thanks to the Mikanagi family."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"Dr. Mikanagi often looks after us. Doctors won't come out to such a remote place, so it's a huge help."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Benio
"Are you asking about Hiroshi? He's been here since long ago, so we're practically like family."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Tsujimura
"Dr. Mikanagi is indispensable here. The Mistress and Lady Shion aren't in the best of health, after all..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Rokuyou
"Hiroshi and I have been stuck with each other for years, so I know a lot. Even back in med school, he seemed to be breaking plenty of hearts."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"Dr. Mikanagi appears to be an excellent physician. He specializes in internal medicine, but I'm sure he could handle simple surgeries if needed."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Mikanagi
"Me? My father is the true family doctor for the Nanatsuki. But he's getting on in years, so I've been staying here lately."
＃Protagonist
"Is that so?"
＃Akane
"Eh, Dr. Mikanagi!? Um, well... wouldn't he be in the infirmary...?"
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Narumi
"Dr. Mikanagi? He has a bit of a light air about him. Though he hardly ever says a word to me."
＃Protagonist
"I-I see..."
