I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Huh... I guess he's not in."
Even after waiting, there was no response.
It can't be helped; I'll head elsewhere.
I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and a weary-looking Tsujimura-san appeared.
#Tsujimura
"Ah... it was you."
#Protagonist
"Eh... um, Tsujimura-san, is something wrong?"
#Tsujimura
"Oh, how embarrassing... it seems I was struck by someone..."
#Protagonist
"Eh... when did this happen?"
#Tsujimura
"About thirty minutes ago... I was in the hall when I was suddenly hit from behind... dear me, how pathetic..."
#Protagonist
"Um, do you have any idea who did it?"
#Tsujimura
"I haven't the slightest clue... after all, it came from behind..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"Ah, also, the cause of the blackout was a blown fuse in the basement generator."
#Protagonist
"A fuse?"
#Tsujimura
"I didn't see any other broken lines, so I don't think it was intentional, but..."
Tsujimura-san seemed concerned about that as well.
#Protagonist
"Does it look like it can be fixed?"
#Tsujimura
"...If I recall, there should be spare fuses left in the storage room..."
#Protagonist
"Um, I'll do it."
#Tsujimura
"B-But... I couldn't possibly let a guest do such a thing..."
#Protagonist
"I'll be fine. Besides, I can't leave it to you when you're injured, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Is that so... my apologies."
#Protagonist
"Um, so what should I do?"
#Tsujimura
"There should be replacement fuses and tools in the storage room. If you could use those to fix the generator in the basement..."
#Protagonist
"Understood, leave it to me."
First, the storage room.
I bowed to Tsujimura-san and decided to head for the storage room.
I’ve come to the front of Tsujimura-san's room.
I knock on the door.
#Protagonist
"Tsujimura-san, it's me."
The door opened, and a weary-looking Tsujimura-san appeared.
#Tsujimura
"How can I help you?"
#Protagonist
"Um... Tsujimura-san, is your head alright where you were hit?"
#Tsujimura
"Yes, it still hurts, but I'm icing it, so there's no need to worry."
#Protagonist
"I see... take care of yourself."
I bowed and left the area.
