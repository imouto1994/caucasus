The survivors gathered in the main hall.
Me, Narumi-san, Tsujimura-san, and Takamine-san.
There were supposed to be twelve of us...
#Takamine
"When dawn breaks, people will come from the foot of the mountain. Everyone stays here until then."
#Protagonist
"...What should we do about Akane-san?"
#Narumi
"...There's nothing we can do. If we go looking for her carelessly, there's a chance we'll be the ones getting killed."
#Tsujimura
"But... did Hiyama-san really do such a thing...?"
#Protagonist
"It hasn't been confirmed, but..."
#Takamine
"At the very least, staying here will prevent any further victims. We have no other choice."
#Narumi
"I suppose... we should have done this from the beginning."
Narumi-san sat down on the floor in the corner of the room.
#Narumi
"...Don't anyone come near me. It's not like I trust any of you."
#Takamine
"...Right. That's for the best."
Takamine-san leaned against the wall on the opposite side from Narumi-san.
#Tsujimura
"...Let's wait for morning..."
#Protagonist
"...Yeah."
