I went back to my room and waited for a while until there was a knock on the door.
Before I could answer, the door opened and Narumi-san walked in.
#Narumi
"Ready to go?"
#Protagonist
"I guess... Dr. Mikanagi warned me, though. He told us not to do anything reckless."
#Narumi
"I don't have any intention of being reckless."
#Protagonist
"If you say so..."
I didn't know how much of that was true.
#Narumi
"First is the code. Did you figure anything out since then?"
#Protagonist
"I asked Benio-san, and I found out the last word means 'fireplace' in German."
#Narumi
"Fireplace... there are a lot of those."
#Protagonist
"Yeah... so I think this '1SN' part represents a location."
#Narumi
"A location... I wonder if the number means the first floor?"
#Protagonist
"In English, it's '1F,' right? Is it '1S' in German?"
#Narumi
"Don't ask me... isn't that how they did it?"
#Protagonist
"Let's assume that's the case. Then the 'N' at the end... is that a direction?"
#Narumi
"North?"
#Protagonist
"In English, it's 'North,' right? Is it the same in German?"
#Narumi
"I told you, don't ask me!"
#Protagonist
"But if that's the case... is it the 'fireplace in the north of the first floor'...?"
#Narumi
"First floor north... that would be the private rooms and the chapel... I can't imagine any clues would be left in the guest rooms, though..."
#Protagonist
"Let's go to the chapel. You can open the lock, right?"
#Narumi
"Well, I can manage... but was there a fireplace in the chapel...?"
