I arrived at Narumi-san's room on the east side of the first floor.
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Narumi-san emerged.
#Narumi
"What do you want at this hour...?"
#Satoshi
"Narumi-san, I want to protect you tonight."
#Narumi
"...Ah, right."
...She replied in an incredibly cold voice.
#Narumi
"Protect me from what?"
#Satoshi
"Well, from the culprit, of course."
#Narumi
"Why would I be targeted?"
#Satoshi
"Well... I just had a feeling."
#Narumi
"...Look, there are dozens of other people who are more likely to be targeted."
#Satoshi
"Th-That might be so, but..."
#Narumi
"Don't worry about me. You're a guest, so just get some rest in your room."
With just that, Narumi-san went back into her room.
#Satoshi
"...Phew."
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
