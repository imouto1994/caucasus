I arrived at Narumi-san's room on the east side of the first floor.
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, it's me.」
The door opened, and Narumi-san emerged.
＃Narumi
「What do you want at this hour...?」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san, I want to protect you tonight.」
＃Narumi
「...Ah, right.」
...She replied in an incredibly cold voice.
＃Narumi
「Protect me from what?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, from the culprit, of course.」
＃Narumi
「Why would I be targeted?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... I just had a feeling.」
＃Narumi
「...Look, there are dozens of other people who are more likely to be targeted.」
＃Protagonist
「Th-That might be so, but...」
＃Narumi
「Don't worry about me. You're a guest, so just get some rest in your room.」
With just that, Narumi-san went back into her room.
＃Protagonist
「...Phew.」
It can't be helped; I'll head back to my room and rest.
