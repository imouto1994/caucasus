At the far end of the east side on the second floor.
Souko-san was standing by the grand piano.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
#Souko
"Oh, what's up?"
#Protagonist
"And what about you, Souko-san... are you doing rounds?"
#Souko
"I thought I'd see if I could find any clues."
#Protagonist
"I wonder... we've already searched everything."
#Souko
"True. Since time has passed, even if something had been left behind, there's a chance the killer took it away."
#Protagonist
"Yeah..."
#Souko
"By the way, did you need something?"
Souko-san was still in the music room when I entered.
#Souko
"Oh, what's up this time?"
I've come to the room at the far end of the east side on the second floor.
A grand piano is placed on a slightly elevated stage.
Now then, what should I do.
