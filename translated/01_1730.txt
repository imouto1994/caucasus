When we stepped out of the carriage, a bridge stood directly before us.
It was an old wooden suspension bridge that looked as if it might rot and collapse at any moment.
#Benio
"My home is just on the other side."
She spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
#Protagonist
"The other side, you say..."
The suspension bridge creaked and groaned as it swayed.
It wasn't exactly a sheer cliff, but if I slipped and fell, there was no way I'd survive.
#Benio
"The carriage cannot go any further than this, you see."
Benio-san checked the luggage the coachman had unloaded from the carriage.
#Benio
"Three days from now, then."
#Coachman
"Yes, ma'am. I'll be bringing the fuel then."
#Benio
"Right. If anything else is needed, I shall call. I'm counting on you."
#Coachman
"Understood, Lady Benio."
The coachman bowed and climbed back into the carriage.
#Souko
"She's quite something, isn't she?"
Souko-san whispered into my ear.
#Protagonist
"She definitely has the air of a high-born lady."
#Souko
"It’s like she was born knowing exactly how to command others."
#Protagonist
"Aren't you pretty much the same, Souko-san?"
#Souko
"I am most certainly not. Anyway, never mind that—go help her with her bags."
Souko-san poked me in the back, nudging me toward Benio-san.
#Protagonist
"Ah, Benio-san, would you like me to carry those for you?"
#Benio
"Oh no, I couldn't possibly ask a guest to do such a thing."
#Souko
"Please, don't hesitate to use him. His physical stamina is about the only thing he can be proud of."
#Protagonist
"That's not true at all."
#Benio
"Hehe... and yet, isn't he already carrying your luggage as well?"
#Souko
"It's light, so it's fine."
Actually, Souko-san, that cola of yours is incredibly heavy.
#Benio
"You really don't have to push yourself, you know?"
#Protagonist
"I don't think I'm overdoing it, but..."
With my rucksack and Souko-san's on my back, I took Benio-san's bags in both hands.
I could manage to walk, but crossing that suspension bridge like this was a little terrifying.
#Souko
"Were you out doing some shopping?"
#Benio
"Yes. Normally our maid handles it, but I had some errands of my own to attend to in the city."
#Souko
"It must be difficult, traveling from all the way out here."
#Benio
"Quite. In the summer, one can drive a car up this far, but once the snow piles up, that's no longer an option."
#Protagonist
"Can a carriage climb higher than a car?"
#Souko
"Horses are much better for snowy roads. A car would just slide all over the place."
#Benio
"Exactly. Shall we proceed, then?"
Benio-san began to walk.
I followed behind her, staggering slightly.
As we neared the suspension bridge, the sense of dread only intensified.
#Protagonist
"...It would be a disaster if someone fell, wouldn't it?"
#Souko
"Is there no other way in?"
#Benio
"There is none. If this bridge were to be destroyed, we would be completely isolated."
Benio-san gave a melodic little laugh.
#Protagonist
"I really don't think that's something to laugh about."
I carefully watched my step as I slowly made my way across the bridge.
#Protagonist
"Souko-san."
I called out to Souko-san behind me.
#Souko
"What is it?"
#Protagonist
"Don't even think about pushing me from behind, even as a joke."
#Souko
"I won't. It would be a catastrophe if my cola fell."
I wish she’d worry about me just a little bit.
#Souko
"The wind is so strong..."
The snow was blowing almost horizontally.
#Benio
"Once we cross the bridge and pass through the woods, we'll be right there. Please bear with it for a moment longer."
#Protagonist
"I'm fine, but..."
I wondered if Souko-san's hand was alright.
Having finished crossing the suspension bridge, I let out a sigh of relief.
A line of trees stood ahead of us, with a narrow path winding between them.
I still couldn't see any buildings from here.
#Souko
"Is the place up ahead the 'Nanatsuki-kan'?"
#Benio
"That seems to be what it is called in the village."
#Protagonist
"Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"Apparently, it's not written with the character for 'moon,' but with the one for 'haunt' or 'possess.'"
#Benio
"The Nanatsuki family originally used that character, I am told. Though it was changed several generations ago because the name was considered quite unlucky."
#Protagonist
"Well, the moon in the sky is certainly much prettier."
#Benio
"Indeed it is."
Once we entered the woods, the wind and snow seemed to calm down somewhat.
#Benio
"Are you familiar with the appearance of the Nanatsuki-kan?"
#Souko
"I've heard stories. Something about it being built by an architect from abroad."
#Benio
"It was apparently built shortly after the start of the Meiji era. At the time, there were no other Western-style mansions of this scale in the Tohoku region."
Benio-san began her explanation as she walked slowly.
#Benio
"It is said that the head of the family at the time was so enamored with a building he saw overseas that he had a replica built here."
#Protagonist
"What does it look like?"
#Benio
"Well, it would be best for you to see it for yourselves."
Benio-san raised her arm and pointed ahead.
Through a break in the trees, something like a black mountain appeared.
It was a building whose outer walls were painted jet black.
Its overwhelming presence was such that one could never lose sight of it, no matter how the snow raged.
It looked like a void of darkness, as if a piece of the world had been hollowed out right there.
A large clock was mounted high above the entrance.
#Protagonist
"So this is the Nanatsuki-kan..."
#Benio
"It is quite unusual, is it not? Even now, many strange artifacts remain within."
#Souko
"I wonder if those are what gave rise to the legends."
#Benio
"Perhaps. If the opportunity arises, I shall tell you all about them."
Benio-san wore an indescribable smile.
#Benio
"But before that, we must see to your exhaustion. And it seems Kirihara-san is injured as well."
#Souko
"You noticed?"
Souko-san seemed a little surprised.
#Benio
"I noticed you were shielding your hand for some time now. Our family doctor is in residence here, so it would be best to have him examine it later."
#Souko
"I see. Thank you."
#Benio
"Now then, welcome... to the Nanatsuki-kan."
Benio-san gave a graceful bow, gesturing toward the jet-black mansion towering before us.
