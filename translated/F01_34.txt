Before going to the tower, I should first try asking Tsujimura-san in the office.
I should probably get permission from Tsujimura-san before going to the tower.
I go out through the door in the back of the office and walk through the garden where the snow continues to fall to approach the tower.
Likely due to the heavy blizzard, I can't hear the singing.
Perhaps she isn't singing anymore.
The door at the base of the tower was open.
When I stepped inside, I heard a singing voice from above.
The interior was empty, with stairs winding upwards along the wall.
I decided to try going up the stairs.
At the top of the stairs was a door.
This must be Shion-san's room.
I stood there for a while, listening to her song.
Eventually, the voice ceased.
It was then that I lightly knocked on the door for the first time.
＃???
"Who is it... Seiji?"
＃Protagonist
"Um, excuse me. My name is (NAME01) (NAME02), and I was rescued by this household. I wanted to offer a word of greeting."
＃???
"I see... I'm not in a position to say, but please, make yourself at home."
She must be on guard; there's no sign of her opening the door from the inside.
＃Protagonist
"Yes. ...So, it sounded like you were singing just now."
＃???
"Y-Yes... is something wrong with that...?"
＃Protagonist
"You have a beautiful singing voice."
＃???
"Eh... A-Ah, thank you..."
＃Protagonist
"Oh, and congratulations on your wedding."
＃???
"...Thank you."
＃Protagonist
"Well then, I'll be going now. ...Excuse me."
I was concerned that she seemed somewhat listless, but I decided to leave the area.
Once outside, I looked up at the tower.
Shion-san...
Why is she in a place so far removed?
I want to hear her voice once more.
I enter the tower and head up the stairs.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃???
"Yes...?"
＃Protagonist
"Hello, it's (NAME01)."
＃???
"Do you need something...?"
＃Protagonist
"I thought we might talk for a bit..."
＃???
"...I'm sorry, but I have preparations for the ceremony..."
＃Protagonist
"Ah, right. Sorry for bothering you."
I decided to make a hasty retreat.
