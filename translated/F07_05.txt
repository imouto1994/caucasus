「Oh, is something the matter?」
Tsujimura-san was in the office.
＃Protagonist
「Hello. Are you in the middle of work?」
＃Tsujimura
「Not at all. Did you need something?」
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, is something the matter again?」
Tsujimura-san was still in the office.
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me.」
When I entered the office, Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were there.
＃Tsujimura
「How can I help you?」
＃Protagonist
「I was just in the middle of doing a quick patrol...」
＃Shion
「Oh my... Thank you for your hard work.」
＃Protagonist
「No, I'm just doing it on my own accord.」
Now then... what should I do?
When I entered the office, Tsujimura-san and Shion-san were there.
＃Shion
「Oh... what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Uh, well...」
