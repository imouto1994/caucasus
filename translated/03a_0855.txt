"Um... Akane-san..."
#Akane
"...Do you despise me now?"
#Main Character
"No, of course not... never. It's not that... please, tell me more about your sister."
#Akane
"...They say 'spiritings' have been happening around here for a long time. Mostly young women going missing..."
#Main Character
"...There are many legends of that sort in the Tohoku region. Even the 'Tono Monogatari' has several entries on it."
#Akane
"But my sister disappeared only recently. From what I’ve found, even after the war, many young women went missing in this area."
#Main Character
"Is that right..."
#Akane
"Yes... Also, are you familiar with the 'Curse of the Nanatsuki'...?"
#Main Character
"...I don't know the specifics..."
#Main Character
"Yes... Benio-san told me about it. Now that you mention it, spiritings were part of it."
#Akane
"There are rumors of the 'Nanatsuki Sacrifice'... I thought it might be related somehow."
#Main Character
"I see... Understood. I'll look into it as much as I can. That's why I came here in the first place."
#Akane
"But, um... please, be careful."
#Main Character
"Yeah... I know."
