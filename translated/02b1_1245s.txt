There's a small window for letting in light.
It doesn't seem to be locked, but it's so small that it'd be impossible for a person to pass through.
There's no chance the culprit came in or out through here.
＃Protagonist
"This is the rope that was around Ai-san's neck..."
＃Souko
"Wire is woven into it... it doesn't look like it'd be easy to cut."
＃Protagonist
"One end is firmly fixed to the wall... the other end was caught in the gears of the clock."
...This rope is likely what took Ai-san's life.
＃Protagonist
"What is this stick...?"
I picked up a piece of wood that had fallen to the floor.
＃Souko
"It doesn't look like something that has any particular meaning, but..."
A wooden stick is lying there.
The gears that move the clock.
Their movement has been stopped now.
The gears aren't moving.
A small piece of trash, like a scrap of paper, is lying on the floor.
It doesn't seem to be anything special, but...
No matter how many times I look at it, it just looks like trash.
Dr. Mikanagi placed his hands together in prayer before Ai-san's body and began the autopsy.
＃Mikanagi
"...There's a contusion on the head, but this isn't the direct cause of death. It seems death was indeed caused by suffocation due to neck compression."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
...It seems Ai-san's cause of death was suffocation.
