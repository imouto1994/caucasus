"'Akane' and 'Akari', huh... I don't know about anyone else, but I doubt someone would ever mistake their own name..."
＃Protagonist
"True..."
＃Maya
"...I am sorry, I do not really know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Ai
"...I'm sorry, I don't really know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"Isn't it strange to use 'M' as the initial for 'Hiyama'? If you made that much of a mistake, you'd notice, and normally you'd just start over."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
＃Shion
"Um... I'm sorry, I don't really know..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Tsujimura
"Mistakes do happen... For instance, Lady Benio writes her name as 'Venio' in romanized spelling, you see."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I can't really tell."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"...I'm sorry, but I don't really know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"...Yesterday's handkerchief, right?"
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san said she made a mistake, but I can't believe that. Who on earth is 'Akari M'...?"
＃Mikanagi
"...I know one person with a name that matches that."
＃Protagonist
"...The person in the photo in your room?"
＃Mikanagi
"...You saw it."
＃Protagonist
"...Sorry."
＃Mikanagi
"There's no need to apologize. I'm the one who sent you to get the bag."
＃Protagonist
"So... is it her?"
＃Mikanagi
"...She is Akari Misono, the person I cared for most."
＃Protagonist
"Was she someone who worked here?"
＃Mikanagi
"...Until a while ago."
＃Protagonist
"But if it's her... why does Akane-san have it..."
＃Mikanagi
"...Regarding that, it would be better to ask Akane-san. Besides, there's no guarantee the embroidery on that handkerchief refers to her."
＃Protagonist
"True... I understand."
＃Akane
"L-Like I said! I told you yesterday I just made a mistake...!"
＃Protagonist
"I-I see..."
＃Akane
"That's... I'm sorry, I can't right now..."
＃Protagonist
"I see... I understand."
＃Narumi
"...I don't think that girl can embroider, though... Did she really sew it herself?"
＃Protagonist
"I wonder..."
