I knock lightly on the door.
But there was no response from inside.
Is he not here?
I gave up and decided to head elsewhere.
This is Dr. Mikanagi's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah... it's you. What's the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Dr. Mikanagi. Do you have a moment?」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, I don't mind, but what is it?」
Now, what should I do?
This is Dr. Mikanagi's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
But there was no response from inside.

「So it seems...」
We gave up and decided to head elsewhere.
This is Dr. Mikanagi's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Mikanagi
「Ah... it's you. What's the matter?」
＃Akane
「Dr. Mikanagi, have you seen Lady Ai?」
＃Mikanagi
「Ai-san? ...No, I haven't.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「Please let us know if you see her.」
＃Mikanagi
「Yes, understood.」
We decided to head elsewhere.
This is Dr. Mikanagi's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh, it's you two... Have you still not found Ai-san?」
＃Akane
「No... that's right.」
＃Mikanagi
「I wonder what happened... I'm starting to get worried.」
＃Protagonist
「Well, we're going to keep looking around other areas.」
＃Mikanagi
「Right, I'm counting on you.」
We left the room.
