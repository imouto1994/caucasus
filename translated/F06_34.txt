I exited through the door in the back of the office, walked through the garden where snow continued to fall, and approached the tower.
It's incredibly cold.
Maybe coming out in light clothing was a mistake after all.
The area around the tower door had been thoroughly cleared of snow.
When I reached for the door, it opened easily.
That means she must be in her room.
I stepped inside, brushed the snow off my clothes, and headed up the stairs.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san, it's me."
The door opened, and Shion-san peeked out with an anxious expression.
＃Shion
"...Please, come in."
I entered the room as she requested.
＃Shion
"Is something the matter...?"
＃Protagonist
"...The kitchen is no longer usable."
＃Shion
"Eh... why?"
＃Protagonist
"It seems someone filled the kitchen with gas and caused an explosion."
＃Shion
"That’s... um, was anyone injured...?"
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san suffered light burns, but there's no threat to her life."
＃Protagonist
"Akane-san suffered light burns, but there's no threat to her life."
＃Shion
"I see..."
A look of relief washed over Shion-san's face, but it was quickly replaced by anxiety once more.
＃Shion
"Um... did it start a fire?"
＃Protagonist
"It was a small explosion, so it didn't spread... why do you ask?"
＃Shion
"A... no, it's nothing..."
Shion-san shook her head and looked down.
It certainly didn't look like "nothing"...
＃Protagonist
"...Did something happen?"
＃Shion
"I... I don't know why, but I've always been afraid of fire..."
＃Protagonist
"Afraid of fire...?"
I glanced toward the fireplace in the room.
There were candles in the room as well.
＃Shion
"...No, that's not it. I’m just... terrified of large fires..."
＃Protagonist
"...No one isn't afraid of a fire."
I’m afraid too.
However... there was something strange about the way Shion-san was afraid.
＃Protagonist
"Did something happen in the past?"
＃Shion
"...I don't know. I just don't know..."
She answered faintly, shaking her head.
I couldn't bring myself to ask any further.
I exited through the door in the back of the office, walked through the garden where snow continued to fall, and approached the tower.
It's incredibly cold.
Maybe coming out in light clothing was a mistake after all.
The area around the tower door had been thoroughly cleared of snow.
When I reached for the door, it opened easily.
I stepped inside, brushed the snow off my clothes, and headed up the stairs.
In front of Shion-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Protagonist
"Shion-san..."
No matter how long I wait, there is no response from inside.
Is she out, or does she just not want to come out?
I wanted to ask her about what happened earlier, but it might be impossible.
I gave up and decided to head for another location.
