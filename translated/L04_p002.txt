"The possibility of Maya-san being the killer... I doubt it. ...Unless there was a will stating that the entire estate would be inherited by Ai-san, that is."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Benio
"Mother would have no reason to kill my sister, would she? The inheritance doesn't concern her anyway."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
＃Tsujimura
"The Mistress? She should have been in her room the entire time..."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Takamine
"I wouldn't know."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Akane
"The Mistress has been resting in her room this whole time... the mental strain seems ceaseless."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Narumi
"If it's the Mistress, I think she was in her room the whole time... but the possibility of her killing Lady Ai... well, I can't say it's zero, considering the distribution of the inheritance and all."
＃Protagonist
"...I see."
