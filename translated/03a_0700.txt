...Morning came.
I was in the hall.
...Or rather, I woke up in the hall.
#Main Character
"...So cold."
I was chilled to the bone.
I guess that's what happens when you sleep in a place like this.
I wonder how long I was out.
I'd done so many rounds of the mansion, so it must have been shortly before dawn...
I sat up and stretched my stiff muscles.
I should probably ask Dr. Mikanagi for some cold medicine later.
#Shion
"Ah..."
Turning toward the voice, I saw Shion-san coming out of the western corridor.
#Main Character
"Oh, Shion-san. Good morning."
#Shion
"G-Good morning..."
Shion-san bowed and hurried off into the eastern corridor.
...I guess it's only natural to want to avoid a weirdo sitting on the floor.
#Main Character
"Nn..."
As I stood up and stretched, Tsujimura-san entered the hall.
#Tsujimura
"Good morning."
#Main Character
"Ah, good morning, Tsujimura-san."
#Tsujimura
"Excuse me, but has Benio-ojousama woken up yet?"
#Main Character
"Benio-san...? No, I haven't seen her yet this morning."
Is she still asleep?
#Main Character
"I'll go check on her."
#Tsujimura
"Eh... but... I can't ask a guest to do something like that..."
#Main Character
"Given the situation, let's forget about who's a guest and who isn't. I'll go take a look."
Leaving Tsujimura-san there, I headed up the stairs.
To the western corridor on the second floor.
I'd been making rounds all night, so I thought it would be fine, but a sliver of anxiety remained nonetheless.
Please, let Benio-san be safe—
I knocked on the door.
There was no response.
#Main Character
"Benio-san, please wake up."
I knocked several times, but still no answer.
Don't tell me...
#Main Character
"Benio-san, Benio-san, come on!"
#Benio
"You've been noisy for a while now!"
It was Benio-san's shouting voice.
#Benio
"Hmm? What's wrong?"
Benio-san spoke to me with a puzzled look as I crouched down, clutching my head.
#Main Character
"Don't... don't open the door so suddenly..."
#Benio
"It's because you were being so loud."
#Main Character
"But if I wasn't, you wouldn't wake up, Benio-san..."
#Benio
"Be quiet and shut up."
#Main Character
"...Yes."
#Benio
"Honestly... have you confirmed the safety of the others?"
#Main Character
"I saw Shion-san and Tsujimura-san just now. I haven't checked on the others yet, but..."
#Benio
"Hmph... well, with an idiot wandering around the mansion all night, I suppose there's no need for concern."
#Main Character
"Eh, you noticed?"
#Benio
"Of course. Anyone would notice someone moving back and forth that frequently. You should be grateful you weren't mistaken for the killer."
#Main Character
"You're right..."
#Benio
"...You really didn't have any obligation to go that far."
Benio-san muttered quietly.
#Main Character
"But I didn't want any more victims."
#Benio
"...I suppose."
Benio-san gave a small nod and started walking down the hall.
#Main Character
"Eh, Benio-san...?"
#Benio
"I'm heading to the hall. Everyone will likely be gathering there."
#Main Character
"Yes... but please go change first."
I couldn't exactly let her go in her sleepwear, so I pushed Benio-san back into her room.
