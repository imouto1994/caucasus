...Morning came.
I was in the hall.
...Or rather, I woke up in the hall.
＃Protagonist
「...So cold.」
I was chilled to the bone.
I guess that's what happens when you sleep in a place like this.
I wonder how long I was out.
I'd done so many rounds of the mansion, so it must have been shortly before dawn...
I sat up and stretched my stiff muscles.
I should probably ask Dr. Mikanagi for some cold medicine later.
＃Shion
「Ah...」
Turning toward the voice, I saw Shion-san coming out of the western corridor.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Shion-san. Good morning.」
＃Shion
「G-Good morning...」
Shion-san bowed and hurried off into the eastern corridor.
...I guess it's only natural to want to avoid a weirdo sitting on the floor.
＃Protagonist
「Nn...」
As I stood up and stretched, Tsujimura-san entered the hall.
＃Tsujimura
「Good morning.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, good morning, Tsujimura-san.」
＃Tsujimura
「Excuse me, but has Benio-ojousama woken up yet?」
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san...? No, I haven't seen her yet this morning.」
Is she still asleep?
＃Protagonist
「I'll go check on her.」
＃Tsujimura
「Eh... but... I can't ask a guest to do something like that...」
＃Protagonist
「Given the situation, let's forget about who's a guest and who isn't. I'll go take a look.」
Leaving Tsujimura-san there, I headed up the stairs.
To the western corridor on the second floor.
I'd been making rounds all night, so I thought it would be fine, but a sliver of anxiety remained nonetheless.
Please, let Benio-san be safe—
I knocked on the door.
There was no response.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, please wake up.」
I knocked several times, but still no answer.
Don't tell me...
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, Benio-san, come on!」
＃Benio
「You've been noisy for a while now!」
It was Benio-san's shouting voice.
＃Benio
「Hmm? What's wrong?」
Benio-san spoke to me with a puzzled look as I crouched down, clutching my head.
＃Protagonist
「Don't... don't open the door so suddenly...」
＃Benio
「It's because you were being so loud.」
＃Protagonist
「But if I wasn't, you wouldn't wake up, Benio-san...」
＃Benio
「Be quiet and shut up.」
＃Protagonist
「...Yes.」
＃Benio
「Honestly... have you confirmed the safety of the others?」
＃Protagonist
「I saw Shion-san and Tsujimura-san just now. I haven't checked on the others yet, but...」
＃Benio
「Hmph... well, with an idiot wandering around the mansion all night, I suppose there's no need for concern.」
＃Protagonist
「Eh, you noticed?」
＃Benio
「Of course. Anyone would notice someone moving back and forth that frequently. You should be grateful you weren't mistaken for the killer.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Benio
「...You really didn't have any obligation to go that far.」
Benio-san muttered quietly.
＃Protagonist
「But I didn't want any more victims.」
＃Benio
「...I suppose.」
Benio-san gave a small nod and started walking down the hall.
＃Protagonist
「Eh, Benio-san...?」
＃Benio
「I'm heading to the hall. Everyone will likely be gathering there.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes... but please go change first.」
I couldn't exactly let her go in her sleepwear, so I pushed Benio-san back into her room.
