I’ve entered the Great Hall.
#Ai
"Oh... good morning."
It seems Ai-san had already arrived.
#Protagonist
"Good morning, Ai-san."
#Ai
"Would you like some tea?"
#Protagonist
"Ah, yes, please."
#Ai
"Please, have a seat."
I settle onto the sofa as she suggested.
#Ai
"Would you like yours straight or with milk?"
#Protagonist
"Um... milk tea, please."
#Ai
"Hehe... understood."
With a soft smile, Ai-san brews the tea.
A wonderful aroma begins to waft through the air.
#Ai
"Here you go."
#Protagonist
"Thank you."
I wrap my hands around the warm cup.
#Protagonist
"Say, Ai-san. Do you have a moment?"
#Ai
"Yes, what is it?"
I’ve entered the Great Hall.
#Ai
"Oh, is something the matter?"
Ai-san was enjoying some tea by herself.
#Protagonist
"Hello, Ai-san. Do you have a moment right now?"
#Ai
"Yes, what's on your mind?"
When I entered the Great Hall, Takamine-san was there.
#Protagonist
"Good morning."
#Takamine
"Hm? ...Oh, it's you. Morning."
He seems as grumpy as ever.
#Protagonist
"Um, do you have a second?"
#Takamine
"...What is it?"
When I entered the Great Hall, Takamine-san was there.
#Takamine
"Hm? ...Oh, it's you."
He seems as grumpy as ever.
#Protagonist
"Um, do you have a second?"
#Takamine
"...What is it?"
Souko-san had arrived in the Great Hall.
She seems to be relaxing with Ai-san and Takamine-san.
Now then, who should I talk to...?
