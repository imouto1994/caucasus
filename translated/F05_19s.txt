ItÅfs pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
Inside a glass case, there's an expensive-looking vase.
It's designed so you can't touch it, which provides a bit of relief.
An expensive-looking vase is on display.
