It’s pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.
Inside a glass case, there's an expensive-looking vase.
It's designed so you can't touch it, which provides a bit of relief.
An expensive-looking vase is on display.
A large table is placed here.
I don't really understand its value, but I’m sure it's not a cheap piece...

"This is..."
Many wigs are lined up on the shelf.
They must all belong to Maya-san.
But... Maya-san already has such lush hair, I can't really imagine her wearing these.
Well, she's a woman after all; perhaps she wants to change her mood once in a while...
They're likely fashion wigs.
I’m curious, but...
I probably shouldn't touch them without permission.
I’ve already let myself in... I’ll stop here.

A scrap of paper is peeking out from a drawer.

"Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 8"
The man was crying silently. I apologized to him and once again poked the toothpick into the round object. Then, without hesitation, I put it into my mouth.
Immediately, the taste of undercooked dough spread through my mouth. The octopus had lost all its elasticity. It went beyond being "unpalatable"—I felt a sense of utter emptiness.
Is this what the man calls a "small happiness"...? No, compared to the wartime when there was hardly anything to eat, being able to eat even something like this is happiness!
...I told myself that believing this was what truly mattered. ~To be continued~

A scrap of paper titled "Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 8" is wedged here.
I’m curious, but...
