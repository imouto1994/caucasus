By the time I return to the hall, people are starting to gather.
＃Takamine
"What happened?"
Takamine-san asks.
＃Souko
"Yes…… it seems the generator was tampered with."
＃Mikanagi
"Whatever for……?"
＃Benio
"Doctor, first we're going to confirm everyone's safety."
Benio-san cuts Dr. Mikanagi off and speaks up.
＃Benio
"Lawyer Takamine and the Doctor are here. Where are Mother and the others?"
＃Mikanagi
"Maya-san is in the drawing room. Narumi-san and Akane-san are there as well."
＃Benio
"……What happened to Shion?"
＃Mikanagi
"She's likely in her room, isn't she?"
＃Protagonist
"I'll go check on her."
I say that before I even think.
＃Benio
"Hmm…… alright. Then I'll leave it to you."
Seeing Benio-san nod, I hurry toward Shion's tower outside the manor.
