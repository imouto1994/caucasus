"Tsujimura-san, huh... He could have triggered the blackout, but he's not the only one who could've done it..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Maya
"If it's Tsujimura, I imagine he was trying to fix the blackout."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"...Tsujimura has no reason to kill my sister. Besides, he was attacked by someone just before the lights went out, you know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"When the lights went out and I went to the office because things seemed wrong, Seiji-san was clutching his head. He said someone had struck him..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"It was just before the blackout, I believe... I was in the hall when I was suddenly struck from behind... When I came to, I was lying near the basement stairs."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...Apparently, someone attacked Tsujimura-san before the blackout. It might have been when the killer was tampering with the generator, but..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Mikanagi
"It looks like Tsujimura-san sustained a minor head injury, but it doesn't seem to be anything too serious."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"I heard Tsujimura-san was injured... I wonder what on earth happened..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Narumi
"It sounds like Tsujimura-san got hurt. I don't know the details, though..."
#Satoshi
"I see."
