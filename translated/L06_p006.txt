「Tsujimura-san, huh... He could have triggered the blackout, but he's not the only one who could've done it...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Maya
「If it's Tsujimura, I imagine he was trying to fix the blackout.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「...Tsujimura has no reason to kill my sister. Besides, he was attacked by someone just before the lights went out, you know.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「When the lights went out and I went to the office because things seemed wrong, Seiji-san was clutching his head. He said someone had struck him...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「It was just before the blackout, I believe... I was in the hall when I was suddenly struck from behind... When I came to, I was lying near the basement stairs.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「...Apparently, someone attacked Tsujimura-san before the blackout. It might have been when the killer was tampering with the generator, but...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Mikanagi
「It looks like Tsujimura-san sustained a minor head injury, but it doesn't seem to be anything too serious.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「I heard Tsujimura-san was injured... I wonder what on earth happened...」
＃Protagonist
「True...」
＃Narumi
「It sounds like Tsujimura-san got hurt. I don't know the details, though...」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
