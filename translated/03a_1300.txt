I was starting to get hungry, so I headed to the eastern side of the first floor.
The kitchen was out of commission.
Still, if I asked Narumi-san, she’d probably find a way to help.
I gave a light knock on Narumi-san's door.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, it's me."
#Narumi
"Nnh, what is it?"
Narumi-san came out.
#Main Character
"What are we doing for lunch? The kitchen is unusable now..."
#Narumi
"Ah... I was thinking of making a salad, is that alright?"
#Main Character
"Yeah, I don't mind, but..."
#Narumi
"Then it's settled. Come along."
Narumi-san grabbed my arm and started walking.
#Main Character
"Eh... eh?"
Unable to even resist, I was dragged along.
#Narumi
"There's vegetables in the basement storage. We can't use the ones in the kitchen anymore."
#Main Character
"Well, I suppose... but why me too?"
#Narumi
"To carry the bags, obviously."
Narumi-san answered as if it were perfectly natural.
#Main Character
"Sigh..."
Narumi-san surely has much more stamina than I do.
With practiced hands, Narumi-san unlocked the door to the basement.
#Narumi
"Alright then."
We went down to the basement.
It was a different room from the one where I’d fixed the generator last night.
#Narumi
"Put the vegetables in that box."
Narumi-san said, swinging a flashlight around.
#Main Character
"Any of them?"
I asked, holding a potato in one hand.
#Narumi
"Choose things that don't need to be cooked."
#Main Character
"...Then I guess we don't need this."
I put the potato back in the wooden box.
#Narumi
"Apples... we have those. And cabbage... was that buried in the snow outside? Dig that up for me later."
#Main Character
"Me?"
#Narumi
"Of course. I hate the cold."
#Main Character
"Sigh..."
Well, we can't eat them if they aren't dug up...
#Main Character
"Can it wait until later?"
#Narumi
"Yeah, first I need you to take the things from here."
Narumi-san placed a wooden box in front of me.
It was stuffed with a large quantity of vegetables.
#Main Character
"Wait... do we really need this much?"
#Narumi
"There are a lot of people to feed, after all."
#Main Character
"...Can you eat eggplant raw?"
#Narumi
"If we can't, I'll drag out a charcoal stove and try roasting them."
There was a sound like something falling over.
#Main Character
"Hmm...?"
I turned my gaze toward the sound—the entrance to the storage room.
The door was closed.
#Narumi
"Oh... I wonder who that is."
Narumi-san approached the door.
#Main Character
"What's wrong?"
#Narumi
"Hmm..."
Narumi-san groaned in front of the door and turned around.
#Narumi
"...It seems we've been locked in."
#Main Character
"...Eh?"
Narumi-san was trying to move the door to open it.
#Main Character
"No way... did they lock it...?"
#Narumi
"It’s not locked, there’s a bar across it."
I approached the door as well and looked out of the storage room through the grated window.
I could see something like a rod at the edge of the sliding door.
I tried to move the door, but it only budged a tiny bit.
#Main Character
"Um... what does this mean...?"
#Narumi
"It means we're trapped,"
Narumi-san said simply.
#Narumi
"What on earth are they planning to do by locking us in here, honestly..."
Narumi-san cursed and kicked the door, but it didn't budge an inch.
#Main Character
"The culprit did this, didn't they...?"
#Narumi
"Right? There’s no reason for anyone else to do something like this now."
Narumi-san was reaching her arm through the gaps in the grate.
#Narumi
"...Aah, just a little more..."
#Main Character
"...You’re surprisingly calm."
The thought suddenly occurred to me.
#Narumi
"...You think so?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... this is the kind of situation where you’d expect someone to panic a bit more."
#Narumi
"Well, even if you say that..."
Narumi-san pulled her arm back from the grate.
#Narumi
"...Look, as long as we’re in here, our lives aren't in danger, right?"
#Main Character
"Are you sure...? If someone sets fire to this place, we’ll be in serious trouble."
#Narumi
"...You sure say some scary things so casually."
#Main Character
"It’s not an impossibility, after all."
Even as I said it, I didn't think it would happen.
Somehow... I didn't get the feeling the killer would do something like that.
#Narumi
"In any case, we need to find a way to escape."
#Main Character
"...Right."
