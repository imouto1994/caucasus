We arrived at the performance room.
#Main Character
"Benio-san, if you would."
I handed the sheet music to Benio-san.
#Benio
"'Dedicated to my dear Marino,' huh..."
Benio-san glanced at Maya-san, but said nothing more as she headed for the piano.
#Benio
"Nn... what's this? The keys are broken..."
#Narumi
"Ah, that's..."
#Main Character
"...A key was hidden there. At the 'H5' spot."
#Benio
"The 'B' in the fifth octave... I see."
Benio-san nodded and sat on the bench.
#Benio
"—Well then, I'll begin."
Benio-san began to play the piano.
#Souko
"Eh—"
Souko-san gasped.
I knew it... this song is...
#Souko
"Why..."
#Main Character
"This song... Shion-san was singing a song with the same melody."
I told Souko-san.
#Main Character
"Did Marino-san often sing it?"
Souko-san didn't answer.
She just stood there, listening intently to Benio-san's performance.
I saw something glistening in her eyes.
I wonder what she's thinking right now—
#Main Character
"...If Shion-san were here, she would have let us hear her beautiful singing voice..."
#Souko
"Are you trying to blame me?"
Souko-san's voice was cold.
#Souko
"Do you think I... regret killing my own sister?"
#Main Character
"...If you don't regret it, then why are you crying?"
#Souko
"Don't be stupid."
Though the tone of her voice hadn't changed, tears were streaming down Souko-san's cheeks.
#Souko
"I, regret? ...Regret is something you only do when your goal becomes unattainable."
It was almost exactly when the sound of the piano stopped.
Souko-san moved.
In an instant, she dashed across the room and pinned herself behind Maya-san.
#Main Character
"Souko-san!?"
#Souko
"—Don't move."
Souko-san pressed her bandaged finger against Maya-san's neck.
#Main Character
"What are you—"
#Souko
"I borrowed this from the clinic."
A dully gleaming blade peeked out from the bandage.
#Mikanagi
"A replacement scalpel blade...?"
#Souko
"...Slitting a carotid artery would be easy."
#Maya
"Hih...!"
#Benio
"Mother!"
#Souko
"Benio-san, my mother was killed just like this."
#Main Character
"Stop it, Souko-san!"
#Souko
"I told you not to move, didn't I?"
I couldn't move once I saw the blade biting into Maya-san's neck.
#Souko
"That's better."
Souko-san moved slowly, stepping out into the corridor.
#Benio
"There's nowhere for you to run."
#Souko
"I won't tell you not to follow, but stay back. Otherwise—"
She gently pulled the blade along the neck.
#Maya
"Ah, aaah..."
#Souko
"...I want this woman to taste even more despair."
