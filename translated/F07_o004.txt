"The room Kousei-san used to use. I'm curious, but if we can't get in, there's nothing for it."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
#Maya
"It is the room my husband used while he was alive. We have left it just as it was."
#Satoshi

#Ai
"That's the room Father used. I've hardly ever set foot in there myself."
#Satoshi

#Benio

#Satoshi

#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"It is the room the Master used to use, but it is locked now. I am in charge of the key."
#Satoshi
"I see."

"I don't know much about that room myself. It was reportedly the previous head's room, but... I don't think you can see the inside."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"That room, is it... I've never been inside either, so..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"I heard they've preserved that room exactly as it was when the Master was alive... but I don't think there's anything unusual in there."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
