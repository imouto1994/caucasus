＃Souko
「The room Kousei-san used to use. I'm curious, but if we can't get in, there's nothing for it.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right.」
＃Maya
「It is the room my husband used while he was alive. We have left it just as it was.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Ai
「That's the room Father used. I've hardly ever set foot in there myself.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Benio
「Father's room is off-limits. I've hardly ever been in there myself, after all.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「Is it Father's room...? I don't know much about it...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「It is the room the Master used to use, but it is locked now. I am in charge of the key.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Takamine
「Kousei-san's room is set so that no one can enter. It's a place that has nothing to do with you all.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-You're right...」
＃Mikanagi
「I don't know much about that room myself. It was reportedly the previous head's room, but... I don't think you can see the inside.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Akane
「That room, is it... I've never been inside either, so...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Narumi
「I heard they've preserved that room exactly as it was when the Master was alive... but I don't think there's anything unusual in there.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
