I returned to my room.
＃Narumi
「Ah, welcome back.」
＃Protagonist
「Narumi-san...?」
For some reason, Narumi-san was inside my room.
＃Protagonist
「What are you doing here...?」
＃Narumi
「I needed to talk to you about something. I let myself in.」
Narumi-san began speaking as if there were nothing strange about it at all.
＃???
「Hey, wake up already!」
A voice called out, and my body was shaken.
When I slowly opened my eyes, Narumi-san was standing right in front of me.
＃Protagonist
「Eh... Narumi-san?」
＃Narumi
「I came because I wanted to talk.」
＃Protagonist
「...Right, whatever.」
I gave a half-hearted reply and pulled the covers over my head.
＃Narumi
「...Hey.」
＃Protagonist
「...It has nothing to do with me anymore.」
I didn't feel like doing anything.
＃Narumi
「Listen, you... that's quite enough.」
Narumi-san's hand grabbed my collar.
＃Protagonist
「Eh?」
Before I knew it, I was sprawling on the floor.
My left cheek throbbed with pain.
＃Narumi
「Stop moping around already! When you start acting all pathetic like this, it makes me feel like garbage too!」
Narumi-san's hand grabbed my collar again.
＃Narumi
「Do you think Kirihara-san will come back to life if you stay curled up in your blankets!? Don't screw around with me, and stop pretending to be the protagonist of some tragedy!!」
＃Protagonist
「That wasn't my intention...」
＃Narumi
「Then pull yourself together! If you actually care about settling the score for her!」
＃Protagonist
「I... I want to catch the person who killed Souko-san...」
＃Narumi
「You going to do it...?」
＃Protagonist
「...I will.」
Because I'm surely the only one who can.
＃Narumi
「...Good. Then, let's talk business.」
＃Protagonist
「Business...?」
＃Narumi
「Do you know about the hidden inheritance?」
＃Protagonist
「Hidden inheritance... Takamine-san mentioned it. But we don't even know if it actually exists, right...?」
＃Narumi
「My hunch says it definitely does. There was that code too, right?」
＃Protagonist
「Ah... right, there was.」
I showed the string of characters I had written down to Narumi-san.
＃Narumi
「I'm sure this is the key to the hidden inheritance.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're quite well-informed.」
＃Narumi
「Well, I've done a lot of digging. That lawyer is such a blockhead; I couldn't get my hands on this code no matter what I tried.」
＃Protagonist
「...So that's why you knew about the photo in Takamine-san's room.」
＃Narumi
「Something like that.」
＃Protagonist
「What does this actually mean?」
The characters I'd copied onto the paper read: "1SO K H5 / 1SN KAMIN."
＃Narumi
「Don't ask me. But... that last part looks like some kind of word...」
＃Protagonist
「Kamin... Carmin? It doesn't sound like English... maybe it's a language from a country Kousei-san had ties to...」
＃Narumi
「Also, this can be split into two parts. '1SO K H5' and '1SN KAMIN'.」
＃Protagonist
「They both start with '1S'... Including the 'O' and 'N' that follow, they likely have a similar meaning.」
Having finished copying the characters into her notebook, Narumi-san stood up.
＃Narumi
「Well then, I'll head back to my room and think about it. Let's wait a bit longer before we start moving.」
＃Protagonist
「Ah, right. Understood.」
Narumi-san left the room.
＃Protagonist
「Whew...」
I had been somewhat overwhelmed by Narumi-san's assertiveness...
But that was fine for now.
I didn't think deciphering a code would lead me to Souko-san's killer, but I knew this house was hiding a secret.
And if Souko-san was killed because she got caught up in it?
Then uncovering it might be the only path to the culprit.
...If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be able to do anything at all right now.
I should do some investigating myself.
If only I knew the meaning of that word in the second half, "KAMIN"?
