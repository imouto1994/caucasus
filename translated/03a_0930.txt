I came to the northern part of the first floor because I had something I wanted to ask Takamine-san.
Now that Shion-san had been targeted, it felt more likely that this was a matter related to the inheritance.
I’d heard that Shion-san herself wouldn't receive any inheritance... but that actually made me more curious.
That’s why I desperately wanted to know the details of the will.
I came to the northern part of the first floor because I had something I wanted to ask Takamine-san.
Now that Benio-san had been killed, it was becoming increasingly likely that it was a matter related to the inheritance.
That’s why I desperately wanted to know the details of the will.
I gave a light knock on Takamine-san's door.
＃Protagonist
"Takamine-san, are you there?"
The door opened and Takamine-san peered out.
＃Takamine
"It's you... what is it?"
＃Protagonist
"I’d like to talk to you for a moment..."
＃Takamine
"...I see."
Takamine-san nodded and opened the door wide.
＃Takamine
"It’s about the will, isn't it?"
Takamine-san spoke as soon as he closed the door.
＃Protagonist
"...You’re quick to catch on."
＃Takamine
"I can't imagine you’d be coming to ask me about anything else at this point."
Takamine-san let out a breath.
＃Takamine
"...Now that Benio-kun has been killed, the destination of the inheritance has become limited."
＃Takamine
"...How is Shion-kun doing?"
＃Protagonist
"I don't think her life is in danger."
＃Takamine
"I see... that’s good, then..."
＃Protagonist
"...So, I’d like to ask for more details about the distribution of the inheritance..."
＃Takamine
"As I said yesterday, the distribution is to be split equally among the three of them, excluding Shion-kun."
＃Protagonist
"Is there nothing else? For instance, some property that isn't publicly known..."
＃Takamine
"Hidden assets... I haven't heard anything about that. Of course, there may be things that aren't disclosed to outsiders."
＃Protagonist
"But... you’re the Nanatsuki family’s legal counsel, Takamine-san. For you not to be told..."
＃Takamine
"I simply took over from my father. Even my father likely didn't know everything about the Nanatsuki family."
＃Protagonist
"Is it... really that serious?"
＃Takamine
"...Most of the rumors in the villages around here originate from the Nanatsuki family. It’s said that many of the successive heads of the family were eccentric."
＃Protagonist
"I wonder why that is..."
＃Takamine
"Who knows. Mr. Kousei was said to be quite eccentric as well... Now that you mention it, there was a strange passage in the will."
Takamine-san took several documents out of a shelf drawer.
＃Takamine
"This is it."
On the documents Takamine-san showed me, there was a strange string of characters.
＃Protagonist
"'1SO K H5 / 1SN KAMIN'... what is this?"
＃Takamine
"If I knew, I wouldn't be telling you."
＃Protagonist
"T-True..."
＃Takamine
"I believe it's a phrase that has some kind of meaning..."
＃Protagonist
"May I write this down?"
＃Takamine
"...I’d appreciate it if you could look into it."
With Takamine-san's permission, I copied the string of characters onto a piece of paper.
I suppose it’s some kind of message from Mr. Kousei...
＃Protagonist
"Thank you very much. I'll see what I can find."
＃Takamine
"...The person you really need to find right now is the culprit. Don't forget that."
Takamine-san warned me.
＃Protagonist
"Yeah... I know. Well then, excuse me."
I bowed and left Takamine-san's room.
