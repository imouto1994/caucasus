I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... what is it?」
＃Protagonist
「Hello, Maya-san. There was a bit of an accident in the kitchen just now...」
＃Maya
「An accident... you say?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes. It wasn't anything too serious, but it might be impossible to prepare meals for a while.」
＃Maya
「My... that is quite a predicament, isn't it...?」
I explained the situation while leaving out the finer details, but Maya-san simply wore a look of concern.
＃Maya
「Is there anything else?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, do you have a moment? Of course, if it's an inconvenient time, I'll leave immediately...」
＃Maya
「It's no problem at all. What is it?」
With that, Maya-san guided me into the room.
＃Maya
「So, what was it you wanted to discuss?」
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, do you have a moment?」
＃Maya
「Yes, I don't mind... please, come inside.」
With that, Maya-san guided me into the room.
＃Maya
「What can I do for you?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, you see...」
