「A will, huh... I’m certainly curious about what kind of things were left in it...」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Maya
「I am sorry... but that is not something I can easily discuss with an outsider...」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Ai
「A will? ...I don't know the specifics, but...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「You should ask Takamine about my father's will. He’s the one managing it.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Tsujimura
「...As far as that matter is concerned, there is nothing I can say.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Takamine
「There’s no way I could discuss that with an outsider like you.」
＃Protagonist
「Y-you're right...」
＃Mikanagi
「That’s... not a matter I’m in any position to comment on.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Akane
「A will...? I wonder if the lawyer, Takamine-sama, might know something.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「A will, huh... I suppose it’s where the distribution of the inheritance and such is written... but naturally, I don't know the details.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right.」
