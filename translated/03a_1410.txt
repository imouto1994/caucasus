When I returned to the dining room, Narumi-san was eating cabbage.
#Narumi
"Want some?"
#Main Character
"No... well, actually, I'll take some."
It was just chopped cabbage with salt.
It didn't suit the glittering dining room at all, but right now, I was grateful just to have something to eat.
#Narumi
"No abnormalities?"
#Main Character
"Yeah, well... I didn't confirm everyone myself, but... has Akane-san come back?"
#Narumi
"She hasn't returned yet... she went to Dr. Mikanagi's place, right?"
#Main Character
"Yeah... don't tell me..."
Did something happen—
#Main Character
"...I'll go look."
#Narumi
"Right. Be careful."
