The door to the chapel was firmly locked.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san, if you would."
#Narumi
"...Yeah, yeah."
Narumi-san took out something like a wire and inserted it into the keyhole.

#Narumi
"It's open."
Narumi-san stood up.
#Main Character
"...That was fast."
#Narumi
"Just get inside, quickly."
Urged on by Narumi-san, I stepped through the open door.
Nothing has changed here.
It seems to always maintain its silence.
#Narumi
"We don't have time to just stand around."

"...You're right. I guess this wasn't what the code was pointing to."
#Main Character
"Then is it... somewhere in the guest rooms after all?"
#Narumi
"Maybe we misread the code."
#Main Character
"I'm certain there's something in one of the fireplaces, so shall we just check them all?"
#Narumi
"Even if we do... we'll have to aim for places where there aren't any people."
#Main Character
"Right... let's go."
