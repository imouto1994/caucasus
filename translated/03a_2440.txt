The very back of the first floor north.
The door to the chapel was firmly locked.
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san, if you would."
＃Narumi
"...Yeah, yeah."
Narumi-san took out something like a wire and inserted it into the keyhole.
＃Narumi
"Keep a lookout and make sure no one comes."
＃Protagonist
"Don't worry."
As long as Takamine-san doesn't suddenly walk out of his room.
＃Narumi
"It's open."
Narumi-san stood up.
＃Protagonist
"...That was fast."
＃Narumi
"Just get inside, quickly."
Urged on by Narumi-san, I stepped through the open door.
Nothing has changed here.
It seems to always maintain its silence.
＃Narumi
"We don't have time to just stand around."
＃Protagonist
"Right... first, the fireplace—"
I looked around the room, and only then did I realize.
＃Protagonist
"There isn't one... a fireplace."
＃Narumi
"...You're right. I guess this wasn't what the code was pointing to."
＃Protagonist
"Then is it... somewhere in the guest rooms after all?"
＃Narumi
"Maybe we misread the code."
＃Protagonist
"I'm certain there's something in one of the fireplaces, so shall we just check them all?"
＃Narumi
"Even if we do... we'll have to aim for places where there aren't any people."
＃Protagonist
"Right... let's go."
