I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Mikanagi
「—Ah, it was you.」
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Dr. Mikanagi...?」
It was Dr. Mikanagi who came out of the room.
＃Mikanagi
「She seems to be feeling unwell, so I was checking on her.」
＃Protagonist
「Is she alright?」
＃Mikanagi
「For now, yes. However, it will be a problem if this blackout continues for much longer...」
Dr. Mikanagi muttered while gazing down the dark corridor.
＃Protagonist
「I'm investigating the cause right now.」
＃Mikanagi
「Is that so? Then, can I leave it to you?」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah. I just hope I can fix it as soon as possible.」
＃Mikanagi
「I'm counting on you.」
I parted ways with Dr. Mikanagi and headed for another location.
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Mikanagi
「Oh... did you need something else?」
Dr. Mikanagi appeared.
＃Protagonist
「No... um, how is Maya-san feeling?」
＃Mikanagi
「There's no need for such concern. I expect she's just feeling anxious.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
With everything that's been happening, the mental strain must be relentless.
＃Protagonist
「Um, please tell her to take care.」
＃Mikanagi
「Yeah, I'll tell her.」
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... do you need something?」
Maya-san appeared.
Her complexion didn't look very good.
＃Protagonist
「Maya-san, are you feeling alright?」
＃Maya
「Yes... I had Dr. Mikanagi examine me just a moment ago. More importantly... this blackout...」
＃Protagonist
「I'm in the middle of investigating it, but I think the power should be restored soon.」
＃Maya
「I see... my apologies. Making a guest do such a thing...」
＃Protagonist
「No, I don't mind at all. We should help each other when in trouble.」
＃Maya
「If you say so...」
Maya-san bowed her head to me.
＃Maya
「I look forward to your continued support.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... um, if you aren't feeling well, please do rest.」
＃Maya
「Yes... I suppose I should.」
＃Protagonist
「Well then, I'll be going. Excuse me.」
I bowed and left the area.
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I was about to knock on the door but suddenly stopped.
Maya-san still looked unwell earlier.
It's probably best not to disturb her so many times.
I left the area and decided to head for another location.
