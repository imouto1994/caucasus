We returned to the drawing room, leaving Souko-san and me alone once more.
＃Souko
"This mansion is really something, isn't it?"
＃Protagonist
"So you think so too, Souko-san?"
＃Souko
"Of course. I've never lived a life even remotely like this. It makes me wonder if we're even still in Japan."
＃Protagonist
"Well, they speak Japanese, at least."
＃Souko
"Even people in Hawaii speak Japanese these days. That's not what I mean. It's the atmosphere... the very air feels different."
＃Protagonist
"It certainly has an otherworldly feel to it... but what can you expect? We're so far deep in the mountains."
I glanced toward the window.
The howling wind and swirling snow made it impossible to see anything outside.
The gale seemed even stronger now than when we first arrived.
＃Souko
"It feels like something out of the last century. You could tell me this was the Taisho era and I wouldn't bat an eye."
＃Protagonist
"The Taisho era was in this century, though."
＃Souko
"You really love splitting hairs, don't you?"
Souko-san spoke with exasperation, then suddenly leaned in close to me.
＃Protagonist
"What is it...?"
I asked, my heart racing as she pressed into my personal space.
＃Souko
"You haven't forgotten why we came here, have you?"
＃Protagonist
"Eh? ...Oh, right. We're here to research the legends of Nanatsuki Village."
I decided to keep the fact that I'd briefly forgotten to myself.
＃Souko
"Exactly. There's no doubt that most of the village's legends originate from this family. So, I'm sure we'll find all sorts of things if we investigate this house."
＃Protagonist
"Investigate... you mean like searching the place?"
＃Souko
"Not just that, but talking to people too. Like that lawyer."
＃Protagonist
"Eeeh!? That guy looks terrifying, though."
＃Souko
"If his family has been tied to this house since his father's time, he's bound to know a lot."
＃Protagonist
"If we're going that route, then the doctor must also—"
I choked back my words at the sound of a knock.
＃Akane
"Excuse me. Your rooms are ready now, so I've come to show you the way... is something the matter?"
＃Souko
"No, it's nothing at all."
Souko-san pulled away from me.
＃Akane
"I-I see... then, please follow me."
For some reason, Akane-san's cheeks were flushed.
