＃Protagonist
「I wonder if this is enough.」
＃Souko
「Right...」
Souko-san nodded, but her complexion was poor.
＃Protagonist
「...As expected, being the middle of the night, we haven't gathered much information.」
At this rate, there's no way we can point out the culprit.
＃Souko
「Let's just stick to thinking for now. It would be bad to provoke the culprit by carelessly pointing fingers.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... you're right...」
Am I unable to find the person who killed Benio-san...?
＃Souko
「By the way, at this stage, who do you think the culprit is?」
Souko-san asked after we had moved away from the others.
＃Protagonist
「Eh... me?」
＃Protagonist
「...There's the possibility it's you, Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「Me? Why?」
＃Protagonist
「No, please don't be offended. I know there's no motive or anything, and I know it's not you.」
＃Souko
「I see. Since I don't have an alibi either, as the crime probably happened in the middle of the night.」
＃Protagonist
「Well... that's how it is. That applies to everyone, though.」
I had said it right to her face, so it was very awkward.
＃Souko
「It's not bad to suspect those close to you first. Provided you have a proper reason.」
Laughing, Souko-san patted my shoulder.
＃Protagonist
「Perhaps... it's Benio-san.」
＃Souko
「Why? She's already—」
＃Protagonist
「It's just a possibility. There's no proof that was Benio-san's body.」
＃Souko
「...It's rare to become unable to identify someone just because the head is missing. Even Dr. Mikanagi said for certain it was Benio-san.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Maya-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「...Honestly, I don't know. Maya-san is always in her room... but Benio-san is her own daughter, right?」
＃Protagonist
「...That's the thing... but if the inheritance is involved...」
＃Souko
「To lay hands even on her own daughter... I wonder?」
＃Protagonist
「I don't know. Since there's no proof.」
＃Protagonist
「...Is it possible Ai-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「That's impossible. Since she's already dead.」
＃Protagonist
「...Right.」
I have seen the dead Ai-san clearly with my own eyes.
There's no way she would start moving from there.
＃Souko
「Ai-san? ...But she died.」
＃Protagonist
「But... there's no proof that body was Ai-san... it had no head.」
＃Souko
「Then who are you saying it was?」
＃Protagonist
「That... I don't know, but...」
＃Souko
「That's a difficult point. If you want that theory to pass, you have to make it clear who that body was.」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Souko
「Ai-san? But she's a victim too, isn't she?」
＃Protagonist
「...She might have faked it.」
＃Souko
「Hmm... as a possibility, it isn't non-existent, but I think it would be difficult.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...?」
＃Souko
「Shall we keep it in mind just in case?」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
＃Protagonist
「...Is there a possibility Shion-san is the culprit...?」
＃Souko
「...I wonder. I don't think she has that kind of nerve, but...」
＃Protagonist
「But... I don't think the possibility is zero.」
＃Souko
「...That might be true. Maybe she should be watched... but try not to provoke her carelessly.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I know.」
＃Protagonist
「How about Tsujimura-san?」
＃Souko
「...I see. He's the younger brother of the late head, and he manages the master keys... it wouldn't be impossible for him to carry out everything so far...」
＃Protagonist
「However... he really doesn't look the part. And I don't think he harbors a grudge against Benio-san either...」
＃Souko
「People don't kill only out of grudges. But well, since there's no evidence or anything, it might be impossible to press him.」
＃Protagonist
「Right...」
＃Protagonist
「...There's no way Rokuyou-san is the culprit, right?」
＃Souko
「Probably not. However... since we only confirmed a headless corpse... I suppose the possibility of a swap cannot be ruled out entirely.」
＃Protagonist
「...If there were an extra body somewhere...」
＃Souko
「There's no way things would be that convenient, is there?」
＃Protagonist
「T-True...」
＃Protagonist
「...Is there a possibility Takamine-san is the culprit...?」
＃Souko
「...Honestly, I don't know about that man. I feel like he's hiding something, though...」
＃Protagonist
「There's nothing that could be evidence, but should we be careful?」
＃Souko
「Right... it's better than doing nothing.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah...」
＃Protagonist
「...Is there a possibility Dr. Mikanagi is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「That man? ...But well... if he's performing the autopsies himself, he could fake as much as he wanted...」
＃Protagonist
「Exactly.」
＃Souko
「But then most of what we've investigated so far would become meaningless. Even things like the estimated time of death.」
＃Protagonist
「That... would be a problem...」
＃Souko
「We can't investigate it ourselves, and we likely just have to trust him, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah.」
＃Protagonist
「Is it possible Akane-san is the culprit?」
＃Souko
「Were there any suspicious points?」
＃Protagonist
「Well... she's been acting strangely since last night...」
＃Souko
「I see... we might need to keep a close watch on her.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... right.」
＃Protagonist
「...Perhaps Narumi-san is the culprit.」
＃Souko
「Did you see something?」
＃Protagonist
「No... it isn't exactly like that, but...」
＃Souko
「It's best not to suspect people carelessly, but...」
＃Protagonist
「...You're right.」
＃Souko
「...For now, there are no powerful leads.」
＃Protagonist
「...It's not good to decide someone is the culprit based only on inference.」
＃Souko
「Exactly. We have to find definitive evidence.」
＃Protagonist
「Yeah... I know. However... to find evidence, something else has to happen, doesn't it...?」
＃Souko
「...I don't think this matter will end with this. We still haven't grasped the culprit's purpose.」
Souko-san muttered with a grave expression.
