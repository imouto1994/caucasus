I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Protagonist
「Oh... Maya-san, good morning.」
Is she not here?
But—the door was unlocked.
＃Protagonist
「Excuse me...?」
I softly peek into the room.
It seems Maya-san is out after all.
What should I do...?
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... good morning.」
＃Protagonist
「Good morning, Maya-san. How are you feeling?」
＃Maya
「Well... still not quite well, it seems...」
She looks visibly pale.
As expected, the mental strain of this situation is taking its toll.
＃Maya
「Did you need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, do you have a moment? Of course, if you're not feeling well, I'll take my leave immediately...」
＃Maya
「It's no problem. What is it?」
With that, Maya-san guided me into the room.
＃Maya
「So, what did you want to discuss?」
I’ve come to Maya-san's room at the far western end of the second floor.
I knock on the door and wait for a while.
＃Maya
「Oh... what is it this time?」
＃Protagonist
「Um, do you have a moment?」
＃Maya
「Yes, I don't mind... please, come inside.」
With that, Maya-san guided me into the room.
＃Maya
「What can I do for you?」
