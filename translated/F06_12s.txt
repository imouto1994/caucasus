It’s pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.

「Hm...?」
There's a scrap of paper with something written on it stuck to the toilet lid.
What could this be...?
『Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 3』
After that day's performance ended and I was taking a breather in the dressing room, that man from the stall showed up with a massive amount of takoyaki.
He bluntly told me it was a token of gratitude for letting him do business there.
However, it was clearly far too much takoyaki, and it had already lost its heat, indicating beyond any doubt that they were leftovers.
I tried to refuse, but he wouldn't hear a word of it, stubborn as a mule about not needing to be modest.
To be perfectly honest, I didn't want them.
We went back and forth like that for a while, but finally worn down, I ended up accepting that forbidden stuff.
I just wanted to get it over with since I was exhausted after the performance. ~To be continued~

「...What the hell is this?」
A scrap of paper titled "Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 3" is lying here.
It's a locker where cleaning supplies and such are kept.
It contains things like rags and buckets.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
It's an ordinary mirror.
Of course, it's perfectly clean without any fogging.
A mirror hangs on the wall.
Cold water came out when I turned the faucet.
I suppose this time of year might be a bit rough.
The water has become very cold.
