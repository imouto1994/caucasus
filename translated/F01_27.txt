I've arrived at Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
"Oh, it's you. What is it?"
＃Protagonist
"Could we talk for a moment?"
＃Souko
"I don't mind."
With that, Souko-san led me into the room.
＃Souko
"So, did you find anything out?"
＃Protagonist
"I'm still in the middle of investigating."
＃Souko
"I see. Well, it's not like the mystery of the curse will be solved all at once."
＃Protagonist
"So, about that..."
I've come to Souko-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door.
＃Souko
"What, you again? What is it?"
＃Protagonist
"Could we talk for a moment?"
＃Souko
"Yes, that's fine."
With that, Souko-san led me into the room.
＃Souko
"What is it this time?"
＃Protagonist
"Uh... well..."
