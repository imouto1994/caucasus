When I went up to the second floor, I suddenly found myself wondering about Souko-san.
Considering everything that’s coming, maybe I should talk to her for a bit...
I arrived in front of Souko-san's room.
I knocked on the door and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
I didn't think she'd have gone to bed already...
Without thinking, I reached for the doorknob.
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
It wasn't locked.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san...?"
I peeked inside the room.
—She was there.
She was sitting by the window, looking down.
She didn't even try to look up; I wonder if she didn't even notice me knocking on the door.
#Satoshi
"—Souko-san."
#Souko
"Eh... ah, it's you..."
Souko-san looked up as if startled.
#Satoshi
"You shouldn't leave your door unlocked... it's careless."
#Souko
"...It wasn't locked?"
#Satoshi
"No... are you alright?"
#Souko
"...I suppose even I'm getting quite worn down."
Souko-san let out a deep sigh.
#Satoshi
"It's only natural."
I'm pretty exhausted myself.
#Satoshi
"After all... we still don't know who killed Rokuyou-san..."
#Souko
"It's not your fault alone."
#Satoshi
"But..."
#Souko
"...You're doing well, even in such an abnormal situation."
#Satoshi
"That's... only because I want to be of help to you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"To me...?"
Souko-san blinked in surprise.
#Satoshi
"...Yes. You've always been someone I admired. That's why I followed you this far, and from here on too..."
#Souko
"...I see. Thank you."
Souko-san smiled.
#Satoshi
"Um... I'll protect you, Souko-san."
#Souko
"Protect me...?"
#Satoshi
"...Yes. No matter what happens, I'll definitely protect you to the very end."
#Souko
"Hehe... you're quite cheeky for someone younger than me."
—Then.
Souko-san lunged forward and hugged me.
Involuntarily, I caught her body in my arms.
#Souko
"...And just how do you plan to protect me?"
#Satoshi
"...I don't know. But—I want to protect you."
#Souko
"...You talk as if we're the ones being targeted."
#Satoshi
"...There's no guarantee that we're safe, after all."
#Souko
"I suppose that's true..."
Souko-san tightened her grip.
#Souko
"Hey... can we stay like this for a little longer...?"
#Satoshi
"...Of course."
I tightened my grip as well.
I could feel Souko-san's warmth.
#Satoshi
"I'll stay like this for as long as you want."
#Souko
"Hehe... you really are cheeky..."
I wonder how much time passed just like that.
#Souko
"...Thank you."
Souko-san whispered in a small voice and gently pulled away from me.
#Satoshi
"Souko-san..."
#Souko
"I'm alright now. You have other things you need to do, don't you?"
#Satoshi
"Eh...?"
#Souko
"You have to investigate what's happening in this manor. I'll cooperate too, so let's do our best."
#Satoshi
"...Yeah. I know."
#Souko
"First, we have to make sure there aren't any more victims."
#Satoshi
"You're right."
Yeah.
That's right.
I have to focus on that right now.
I don't know when we'll be able to leave this snow-bound manor, but until then, we have to endure.
#Satoshi
"Um, I'll... go and make the rounds."
#Souko
"Yes. ...Be careful, okay?"
Souko-san's lips were right in front of me.
Without hesitation, I pressed my lips against hers.
