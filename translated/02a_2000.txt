When I went up to the second floor, I suddenly found myself wondering about Souko-san.
Considering everything that’s coming, maybe I should talk to her for a bit...
I arrived in front of Souko-san's room.
I knocked on the door and waited for a while, but there was no response from inside.
I didn't think she'd have gone to bed already...
Without thinking, I reached for the doorknob.
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
It wasn't locked.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san...?」
I peeked inside the room.
?She was there.
She was sitting by the window, looking down.
She didn't even try to look up; I wonder if she didn't even notice me knocking on the door.
＃Protagonist
「?Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「Eh... ah, it's you...」
Souko-san looked up as if startled.
＃Protagonist
「You shouldn't leave your door unlocked... it's careless.」
＃Souko
「...It wasn't locked?」
＃Protagonist
「No... are you alright?」
＃Souko
「...I suppose even I'm getting quite worn down.」
Souko-san let out a deep sigh.
＃Protagonist
「It's only natural.」
I'm pretty exhausted myself.
＃Protagonist
「After all... we still don't know who killed Rokuyou-san...」
＃Souko
「It's not your fault alone.」
＃Protagonist
「But...」
＃Souko
「...You're doing well, even in such an abnormal situation.」
＃Protagonist
「That's... only because I want to be of help to you, Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「To me...?」
Souko-san blinked in surprise.
＃Protagonist
「...Yes. You've always been someone I admired. That's why I followed you this far, and from here on too...」
＃Souko
「...I see. Thank you.」
Souko-san smiled.
＃Protagonist
「Um... I'll protect you, Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「Protect me...?」
＃Protagonist
「...Yes. No matter what happens, I'll definitely protect you to the very end.」
＃Souko
「Hehe... you're quite cheeky for someone younger than me.」
?Then.
Souko-san lunged forward and hugged me.
Involuntarily, I caught her body in my arms.
＃Souko
「...And just how do you plan to protect me?」
＃Protagonist
「...I don't know. But?I want to protect you.」
＃Souko
「...You talk as if we're the ones being targeted.」
＃Protagonist
「...There's no guarantee that we're safe, after all.」
＃Souko
「I suppose that's true...」
Souko-san tightened her grip.
＃Souko
「Hey... can we stay like this for a little longer...?」
＃Protagonist
「...Of course.」
I tightened my grip as well.
I could feel Souko-san's warmth.
＃Protagonist
「I'll stay like this for as long as you want.」
＃Souko
「Hehe... you really are cheeky...」
I wonder how much time passed just like that.
＃Souko
「...Thank you.」
Souko-san whispered in a small voice and gently pulled away from me.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san...」
＃Souko
「I'm alright now. You have other things you need to do, don't you?」
＃Protagonist
「Eh...?」
＃Souko
「You have to investigate what's happening in this manor. I'll cooperate too, so let's do our best.」
＃Protagonist
「...Yeah. I know.」
＃Souko
「First, we have to make sure there aren't any more victims.」
＃Protagonist
「You're right.」
Yeah.
That's right.
I have to focus on that right now.
I don't know when we'll be able to leave this snow-bound manor, but until then, we have to endure.
＃Protagonist
「Um, I'll... go and make the rounds.」
＃Souko
「Yes. ...Be careful, okay?」
Souko-san's lips were right in front of me.
Without hesitation, I pressed my lips against hers.
