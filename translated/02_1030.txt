＃Protagonist
"I think we should stop here for now."
We couldn't keep everyone tied up and keep fuel to the fire of their anxiety forever.
＃Souko
"As a precaution, please try to avoid acting alone."
Souko-san addressed everyone.
＃Benio
"It would be best to either stay here or keep yourselves locked in your rooms."
＃Maya
"...Indeed. I shall return to my room. Akane, come with me."
＃Akane
"As you wish, Madam."
Maya-san left the hall, accompanied by Akane-san.
＃Takamine
"...I’ll do as I please."
Takamine-san stood up.
＃Protagonist
"Takamine-san...?"
＃Takamine
"The killer is among us, isn't that right? I refuse to sit around in a group with someone like that."
＃Benio
"It’s not as if we’ve decided who the culprit is yet."
＃Takamine
"Which is exactly why it's dangerous."
＃Benio
"Staying alone will only play into the killer’s hands."
A faint smile played on Benio-san’s lips.
＃Benio
"Though it’s not as if we know for certain this will lead to a string of murders."
＃Ai
"Stop it, Benio!!"
Ai-san suddenly let out a shrill scream.
＃Ai
"You're always like this! Acting so composed and looking down on us! Always, always... who do you think you are!?"
＃Benio
"Calm down, Sister. You're troubling everyone."
Benio-san tried to soothe Ai-san.
＃Ai
"I’m sure the killer is right here in this room!! I won't be killed! Absolutely not... and I'll protect Shion as well!!"
Ai-san pulled Shion-san into a tight embrace.
＃Shion
"Ah..."
For a moment, Shion-san’s expression stiffened.
＃Benio
"Sister..."
＃Ai
"Who is it... who was it that killed Isamu-san...!"
With bloodshot eyes, Ai-san scanned the people around her.
＃Mikanagi
"...I think it would be best if you didn't provoke the killer."
Mikanagi-sensei gently chided Ai-san.
＃Protagonist
"You might be right. But... we can't just sit still and do nothing, either."
＃Takamine
"...I’m going back to my room."
Takamine-san left the Great Hall.
＃Protagonist
"What about you, Souko-san?"
＃Souko
"Me? ...Well, I think I'll head back to my room for a bit."
After saying that, she leaned in and whispered into my ear.
＃Souko
"I'll come to your room later so we can organize what we've found."
＃Protagonist
"...Understood."
Souko-san left as well.
＃Narumi
"Well then, I guess I'll go get lunch ready."
One by one, everyone began to leave the room.
Even though Souko-san had just warned everyone that acting alone was dangerous.
＃Benio
"Paranoia is setting in."
Benio-san said, sounding almost amused.
＃Mikanagi
"It’s only natural, after something like that happened."
＃Benio
"Well, I’m the same way when it comes to not trusting those around me. ...Now then, I suppose I’ll head back to my room as well."
＃Protagonist
"You too, Benio-san?"
＃Benio
"I have a few things I’d like to think over as well."
＃Mikanagi
"I’ll be returning to the infirmary."
Benio-san and Mikanagi-sensei left as well.
The only ones left were me, Shion-san, Ai-san, and Tsujimura-san.
＃Protagonist
"What do you plan to do now?"
I asked Tsujimura-san.
＃Tsujimura
"What else can we do? We have no choice but to wait... for someone from the base of the mountain to arrive."
＃Protagonist
"Do you have a radio or something?"
＃Tsujimura
"If we did, I would have used it from the start."
＃Protagonist
"...Fair point."
＃Tsujimura
"We have enough food and fuel to last for a while, so that’s not an issue, but..."
＃Ai
"Tsujimura-san."
Ai-san spoke up.
It was as if her earlier outburst had never happened.
＃Tsujimura
"Ai-ojousama, is something the matter?"
＃Ai
"Shion... says her head hurts..."
Shion-san was looking down, leaning against Ai-san for support.
＃Tsujimura
"A-are you alright, Ojousama!?"
＃Shion
"Nnh..."
Shion-san furrowed her brow in pain.
＃Protagonist
"Shouldn't we take her to the infirmary?"
＃Tsujimura
"Y-yes..."
＃Protagonist
"I'll take her."
＃Tsujimura
"No, that's... we can't trouble our guest with that."
＃Protagonist
"We should be cooperating right now. ...Shion-san, can you move...?"
＃Shion
"Y-yes..."
With Ai-san’s support, Shion-san stood up.
＃Ai
"I'm coming too."
＃Tsujimura
"I'll be in the office. Please call for me if anything happens."
＃Protagonist
"Yes, understood."
I offered Shion-san my shoulder, opened the door, and stepped out into the hallway.
