「Dr. Mikanagi, can you tell when Shion-san died?」
＃Mikanagi
「I'm not sure... probably within the last hour, but I can't say for certain.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
Shion-san... why...
Paintings are hanging on the wall.
...They're Tsujimura-san's paintings.
The artwork Tsujimura-san painted looked down upon Shion-san's silent remains.
A cup was rolling on the floor.
＃Protagonist
「...Did she drink the poison with this?」
＃Benio
「We shouldn't touch it carelessly. Fingerprints might remain.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, I know.」
I took out a handkerchief, carefully wrapped the cup, and lifted it.
＃Protagonist
「...A little bit of liquid remains inside.」
＃Mikanagi
「Let me see.」
I handed the cup to the doctor.
＃Mikanagi
「Don't sniff it. If it's cyanide like we suspect, even the gas alone can be lethal.」
＃Protagonist
「...Understood.」
How could this happen...
The snow seems to be weakening.
It'll likely be clear tomorrow, but this mansion...
The snow is letting up.
