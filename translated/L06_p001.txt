"When the blackout happened, I was asleep in my room. I panicked when the lights wouldn't come on after I woke up, but I figured it was best not to move around blindly, so I stayed put."
#Satoshi
"I see. And after that, you were with me repairing the generator..."
#Maya
"I did not see Mistress Kirihara. After all, I was in my own room the entire time as well."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"I haven't seen her since evening, but wouldn't she have been in her room? Once we went to the basement, we were together the whole time..."
#Satoshi
"True..."
#Shion
"I am sorry, I do not really know..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"I don't believe anything in particular happened..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I wouldn't know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Mikanagi
"I didn't see her during the blackout... If Ai-san's head was severed after the electrocution, weren't you with her?"
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"Well... she wasn't in the grand hall..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"Kirihara-san? I'd imagine she was in her room."
#Satoshi
"I see."
