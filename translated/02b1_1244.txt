"This way!"
Akane-san ran along the passage surrounding the atrium.
Beyond that, there was an inconspicuous door.
#Akane
"There's a ladder inside that leads to a room above."
#Protagonist
"Understood. I'll go first."
No telling what might be there.
I swapped places with Akane-san, who had opened the door, and went inside.
I climbed the ladder, the sound of my footsteps echoing.
It was pitch black and I couldn't see a thing.
When I reached the top, I could tell there was a door nearby.
A tiny bit of light was filtering in through a small window in the door, perhaps from outside.
I peeked inside.
#Protagonist
"Ai-san!?"
Ai-san was in there.
...Ai-san's toes were hovering just slightly above the ground.
Something like a rope was wound around her neck, and she was being suspended by it.
...The rope was pulled taut.
I wonder how much time has passed.
#Protagonist
"Ai-san! Are you alright!?"
I reached for the doorknob, but pulled my hand away in surprise at a stinging pain.
The doorknob and a iron pipe running along the wall had been tied together with wire.
#Protagonist
"You've... got to be kidding... right...?"
I tried to turn the knob, but of course the door wouldn't open.
However, it didn't seem to be locked.
But—
#Akane
"No... young lady..."
Akane-san covered her face.
#Protagonist
"We don't... know yet. I have to open it somehow..."
Saying so.
I was remembering that if suffocation continues for more than a minute, there's almost no chance of survival.
