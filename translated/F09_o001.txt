"Apparently, this has been Nanatsuki family territory since a long, long time ago. Since it was far from other villages, maybe a unique culture developed here."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Maya
"It is said that our ancestors reclaimed the land in this area. Since then, this vicinity has reportedly been called Nanatsuki."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"About Nanatsuki Village... In the legends preserved in literature, it's said that the ancestors of the Nanatsuki family settled here long ago, but..."
#Satoshi
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"If it's about Nanatsuki Village, I think you should ask Mother or my sister. They should know much more than I do."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Shion
"For things like that... it would be better to ask Lady Ai..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Tsujimura
"This area has reportedly been called Nanatsuki Village since long ago... but I am not sure whether the Nanatsuki family came first, or if the village started using the name first."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"...I don't know. Try someone else."
#Satoshi
"...Yes."
#Mikanagi
"I think it's best to ask someone from the Nanatsuki family about the origins and things like that."
#Satoshi
"You're right..."
#Akane
"Um... well, since I only came here recently..."
#Satoshi
"You're right, I'm sorry..."
#Narumi
"About Nanatsuki Village, huh... I think it's better to ask the people of this house about things like that."
#Satoshi
"...Good point."
