"She seems to have been injured in that explosion... I hope she's alright."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Souko
"I wonder why she disappeared..."
＃Protagonist
"...I don't know."
＃Maya
"Akane works very hard. She's also very attentive to details."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Maya
"Akane has disappeared... you don't think that girl...?"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know anything yet."
＃Ai
"Akane-san? She's a very hard worker."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Ai
"For Akane-san to disappear... could it be...?"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
＃Benio
"Akane was burned? I find it hard to believe it was just a coincidence..."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Benio
"What was the reason for Akane's disappearance...? Was she taken by the culprit, or is she the culprit herself...?"
＃Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
＃Tsujimura
"Miss Hiyama has minor injuries. She’s resting in her room for now..."
＃Protagonist
"I see."
＃Tsujimura
"Where could Miss Hiyama have gone...?"
＃Protagonist
"We don't know yet..."
＃Takamine
"Whether Hiyama-kun was targeted or just caught up in it by chance... it’s hard to say."
＃Protagonist
"Right..."
＃Takamine
"There are only so many places to go in this mansion... why can't she be found?"
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
＃Mikanagi
"Akane-san's injuries aren't serious. I'm having her rest in her room."
＃Protagonist
"I see..."
＃Mikanagi
"I wonder if it’s related to what happened yesterday... her going into hiding."
＃Protagonist
"...Perhaps."
