I've come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait.
＃Narumi
"Yes... Oh, it's you. What's up?"
＃Protagonist
"I just came to check on how things are going..."
＃Narumi
"Did something happen?"
＃Protagonist
"No, nothing yet."
＃Narumi
"I see. Doing rounds must be tough, but hang in there."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah."
I've come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait.
＃Narumi
"Yes... Oh, it's you again."
I've come to the front of Narumi-san's room.
I knock lightly on the door and wait for a while, but there's no response from inside.
It seems she's not here.
It can't be helped, I'll go somewhere else.
