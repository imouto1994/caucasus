"The possibility of Maya-san being the killer... I doubt it. ...Unless there was a will stating that the entire estate would be inherited by Ai-san, that is."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Benio
"Mother would have no reason to kill my sister, would she? The inheritance doesn't concern her anyway."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
#Tsujimura
"The Mistress? She should have been in her room the entire time..."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Takamine
"I wouldn't know."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Akane
"The Mistress has been resting in her room this whole time... the mental strain seems ceaseless."
#Satoshi
"I see..."
#Narumi
"If it's the Mistress, I think she was in her room the whole time... but the possibility of her killing Lady Ai... well, I can't say it's zero, considering the distribution of the inheritance and all."
#Satoshi
"...I see."
