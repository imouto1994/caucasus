#Souko
"They're certainly a lively bunch, aren't they?"
Once we were back in the hall, Souko-san finally spoke up.
#Benio
"Even so, they're both quite capable. Now then, let's head this way."
Benio-san offered a small smile as she opened the door directly ahead.
Beyond it was a hallway similar to the ones we had seen so far.
#Benio
"The north wing contains the guest rooms and the chapel. The door at the far end is the chapel, where the wedding is scheduled to take place tonight."
#Protagonist
"There's even a chapel here?"
#Benio
"Yes. The Nanatsuki family has been Christian for generations."
#Souko
"Will our rooms be in this wing as well?"
#Benio
"Since most of these are occupied, I'll have yours prepared on the second floor. But first, allow me to introduce you to Takamine-san."
Benio-san gave a light knock on the first door to the right.
#Benio
"Takamine-san, are you in?"
A few moments after she called out, the door creaked open with a groan.
#???
"...Can I help you?"
The man who appeared was a large, imposing figure wearing an eyepatch over one eye.
If I met someone like him on the street, I'd make a point of never making eye contact.
...In fact, I still couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye even now.
#Benio
"These are our new guests. Since they'll be staying the night, I thought I'd introduce them."
#???
"I see."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara. I apologize for the intrusion, but we'll be staying here for the night."
As expected of Souko-san, she didn't seem even slightly rattled by the man's intimidating presence.
#Protagonist
"Ah, I'm (NAME01) (NAME02)."
#???
"I'm Jin Takamine, the legal counsel for this family. Pleasure."
#Protagonist
"You're a lawyer?"
#Takamine
"...Is there a problem?"
He fixed me with a piercing, icy glare that sent a shiver down my spine.
#Protagonist
"N-no, nothing at all..."
#Takamine
"Hmph... is that all then?"
#Benio
"Yes, that's all for now."
#Takamine
"...Very well. Until later."
With a dull thud, the door was shut.
#Protagonist
"Phew..."
#Souko
"What an intense man."
Souko-san voiced exactly what I was feeling.
#Benio
"He's not a bad person. Takamine-san's father was the family's lawyer before him."
#Souko
"There was a scar on his face... it looked like a burn."
#Benio
"Yes, he apparently suffered it a long time ago, but I don't know the details."
Benio-san shook her head.
#Benio
"Now... across from Takamine-san's room is Isamu-sama—Rokuyou-sama's room, whom you met in the hall. Next to that is Tsujimura, who handles the management of the estate."
#Souko
"There's an estate manager as well?"
#Benio
"Tsujimura is my uncle. He used to be a painter, but now he serves as a sort of butler for us."
Benio-san knocked on the door a few times, then tilted her head.
#Benio
"Tsujimura, aren't you there? I'm coming in."
Just when I thought her tone had become completely different from before, Benio-san opened the door without waiting for an answer.
#Protagonist
"Wait, Benio-san?"
Even I wasn't bold enough to just follow her inside.
#Benio
"Hmph, he really isn't here."
Benio-san stepped back out with a pout.
#Protagonist
"B-Benio-san...?"
#Benio
"What is it? ...I mean, is something the matter?"
She corrected herself instantly, offering a sweet smile.
#Protagonist
"Ah... n-no, it's nothing."
I knew it...
#???
"Did you need something, Benio-ojousama?"
A voice came from behind us, and we turned around.
A middle-aged man was standing by the large door at the end of the hall, looking at us.
#Benio
"Were you in the chapel, Tsujimura?"
#???
"Yes, I was preparing for tonight's ceremony. ...And these are the guests who were stranded?"
The man called Tsujimura closed the heavy door and walked toward us.
#???
"I'm Seiji Tsujimura, the manager of this estate."
#Protagonist
"I'm (NAME01) (NAME02)."
#Souko
"I'm Souko Kirihara. Um, Tsujimura-san, are you the Madam's brother?"
#Tsujimura
"No, I was the younger brother of the previous head. I used to paint, but I couldn't make a living at it... so I've been under the care of this house, I'm ashamed to say."
With that, Tsujimura-san gave a deep bow.
#Tsujimura
"I still have preparations to attend to, so if you'll excuse me."
After another deep bow, Tsujimura-san disappeared back inside the chapel doors.
#Protagonist
"He seems like a kind person."
#Benio
"He's just timid. Even though he could have inherited the Nanatsuki family line."
Benio-san muttered with a sigh.
However, despite her blunt language from a moment ago, she didn't seem to actually dislike him.
#Benio
"Now then, let me show you the second floor."
Regaining her composure, Benio-san spoke and opened the door back to the hall.
We climbed the stairs from the hall.
Looking down from above, the sheer size of the place was even more apparent.
