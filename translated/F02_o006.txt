＃Protagonist
「I see...」

「I’ve heard that cathedral has always been used for weddings in the Nanatsuki family.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Benio
「If you want to enter the cathedral, you’ll have to wait a little longer.」
＃Protagonist
「Right.」

「The ceremony is currently underway... Please wait just a bit more.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「You can't go in; the ceremony is in progress.」

「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「I believe Shion-san is likely in the cathedral right now.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Akane
「Cleaning the cathedral is such a chore. It isn't used often so it doesn't get very dirty, but still.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」

「A cathedral that only gets used for weddings... seems a bit decadent, doesn't it?」
＃Protagonist
「I guess so...」
