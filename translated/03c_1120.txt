When I came down the stairs, I heard loud voices coming from the dining room.
＃Protagonist
"Sounds like it's over there."
＃Souko
"I wonder what happened..."
As soon as we stepped into the eastern corridor, the smell of burning hit my nose.
＃Souko
"What... is this?"
Souko-san groaned, covering her mouth.
＃Protagonist
"Narumi-san!?"
Narumi-san was slumped against the corridor wall.
＃Protagonist
"Are you okay!?"
＃Narumi
"Nnh..."
Narumi-san let out a groan and opened her eyes.
＃Souko
"Was there an explosion...?"
＃Narumi
"...Yeah, I was about to go into the kitchen and suddenly..."
Narumi-san stood up with a grimace.
＃Narumi
"Ow ow... I might have gotten burned a bit."
The arm peeking from Narumi-san's rolled-up sleeve was swollen and bright red.
＃Protagonist
"That's not just 'a bit'!?"
Just then, Dr. Mikanagi came running, out of breath.
＃Mikanagi
"What happened!?"
＃Protagonist
"Dr. Mikanagi, Narumi-san is injured, so please treat her."
＃Mikanagi
"A-Ah, alright... let's take her to your room for now."
＃Narumi
"Okay."
Dr. Mikanagi and Narumi-san entered the room right nearby.
＃Protagonist
"I'll go check things out too."
＃Souko
"Right. I'll stay here and look around the kitchen a bit."
