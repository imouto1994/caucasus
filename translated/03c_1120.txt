When I came down the stairs, I heard loud voices coming from the dining room.
#Main Character
"Sounds like it's over there."
#Souko
"I wonder what happened..."
As soon as we stepped into the eastern corridor, the smell of burning hit my nose.
#Souko
"What... is this?"
Souko-san groaned, covering her mouth.
#Main Character
"Narumi-san!?"
Narumi-san was slumped against the corridor wall.
#Main Character
"Are you okay!?"
#Narumi
"Nnh..."
Narumi-san let out a groan and opened her eyes.
#Souko
"Was there an explosion...?"
#Narumi
"...Yeah, I was about to go into the kitchen and suddenly..."
Narumi-san stood up with a grimace.
#Narumi
"Ow ow... I might have gotten burned a bit."
The arm peeking from Narumi-san's rolled-up sleeve was swollen and bright red.
#Main Character
"That's not just 'a bit'!?"
Just then, Dr. Mikanagi came running, out of breath.
#Mikanagi
"What happened!?"
#Main Character
"Dr. Mikanagi, Narumi-san is injured, so please treat her."
#Mikanagi
"A-Ah, alright... let's take her to your room for now."
#Narumi
"Okay."
Dr. Mikanagi and Narumi-san entered the room right nearby.
#Main Character
"I'll go check things out too."
#Souko
"Right. I'll stay here and look around the kitchen a bit."
