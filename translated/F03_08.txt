I’ve arrived at the dining hall.
＃Benio
「Hm, oh, it's just you.」
Benio-san was there.
＃Protagonist
「Benio-san, are you alone?」
＃Benio
「Can't you tell just by looking?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, yes, but... it's dangerous to be by yourself.」
＃Benio
「Dangerous? You think someone is targeting me?」
＃Protagonist
「It's a possibility.」
＃Benio
「Humph... I see.」
Nodding, Benio-san began to sink into thought.
＃Protagonist
「Um... do you have a moment right now?」
＃Benio
「Hm? Oh, I don't mind.」
I’ve arrived at the dining hall again.
＃Benio
「Hm, is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Um...」
When I entered the dining hall, Souko-san and Benio-san were there.
＃Souko
「Oh, what's wrong?」
＃Protagonist
「No, I don't really have any particular business, but...」
＃Benio
「Is it lunchtime?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, I am getting hungry.」
＃Souko
「If you're looking for Narumi-san, she's in the kitchen.」
I should probably ask some questions rather than worry about lunch right now.
Souko-san was in the dining hall.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, Souko-san, are you alone?」
＃Souko
「Yes, why? Are you hungry?」
＃Protagonist
「Well, there's that, but I actually have a bit of business with you, Souko-san.」
＃Souko
「What is it?」
Souko-san was still in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, do you still need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, is that alright?」
Souko-san and Narumi-san were in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, what's wrong?」
＃Protagonist
「No, well, I don't really have any particular business.」
＃Narumi
「Do you want something to eat?」
＃Protagonist
「I can wait a little longer.」
＃Narumi
「I see. I'm planning to have lunch ready a bit after one.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
Now then, what should I do next?
Souko-san and Narumi-san were in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, do you still need something?」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, well.」
Now, which one should I talk to?
I’ve arrived at the dining hall.
＃Benio
「Hm, oh, it's just you.」
Benio-san was there.
＃Akane
「Lady Benio, have you seen Lady Ai?」
＃Benio
「Sister? ...No, I haven't.」
Benio-san tilts her head curiously.
＃Protagonist
「It seems she hasn't been seen for a while now.」
＃Benio
「Hmm... I wonder what she's up to.」
＃Akane
「Please let us know if you see her.」
＃Benio
「Yeah, I got it.」
We decided to search elsewhere.
Benio-san was still in the dining hall.
＃Benio
「Did you find my sister?」
＃Protagonist
「No... not yet.」
＃Akane
「Lady Benio, do you know anything at all?」
＃Benio
「Me? ...I wouldn't know. I'm not really interested in what my sister does in her spare time...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
It can't be helped; let's go search somewhere else.
When I entered the large dining hall, Souko-san and Benio-san were there.
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san, have you seen Ai-san?」
＃Souko
「Ai-san? No, I haven't, but did something happen?」
＃Akane
「She hasn't been seen for a while.」
＃Souko
「I see... Benio-san, have you seen her?」
＃Benio
「No, I haven't seen her either.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...」
＃Souko
「...I have a bad feeling about this.」
Souko-san mutters quietly.
＃Benio
「You're right. Go find her quickly.」
＃Protagonist
「Yes, I know.」
Akane-san and I decided to go search elsewhere.
When I entered the large dining hall, Souko-san and Benio-san were there.
＃Souko
「Did you find Ai-san?」
＃Protagonist
「The thing is... not yet.」
＃Souko
「I see...」
＃Benio
「We should try looking for her as well.」
＃Akane
「Yes. Thank you very much.」
Akane-san bows deeply.
Let's go search somewhere else too.
Souko-san was in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, what are you two up to?」
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san, have you seen Ai-san?」
＃Souko
「Ai-san...? I haven't.」
＃Akane
「I see...」
Akane-san's shoulders slump.
＃Protagonist
「Please let us know if you see her. We'll be looking elsewhere.」
＃Souko
「Yes, I understand.」
We decided to go somewhere else.
Souko-san was still in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Did you find Ai-san?」
＃Akane
「The thing is... not yet.」
＃Souko
「I see... It's strange that she can't be found within this building...」
＃Protagonist
「You're right...」
＃Akane
「We'll try looking elsewhere.」
We decided to go somewhere else.
Souko-san and Narumi-san were in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, what's the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Souko-san, have you seen Ai-san?」
＃Souko
「Ai-san...? No, I haven't.」
＃Narumi
「She hasn't come here either.」
＃Akane
「I see...」
＃Protagonist
「We'll try looking elsewhere.」
We decided to go somewhere else.
Souko-san and Narumi-san were in the dining hall.
＃Souko
「Oh, are you still looking?」
＃Akane
「Yes...」
＃Narumi
「Lady Ai, huh...」
＃Protagonist
「...We'll try somewhere else.」
We decided to search another location.
