It's pure white outside the window; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will let up...
The blizzard outside seems to be getting stronger.

"Hm...?"
A scrap of paper with something written on it is stuck to the toilet lid.
I wonder what it is...
"The Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 3"
After the day's performance was over, while I was taking a breather in the dressing room, the man from the stall came by with a massive amount of takoyaki.
He answered bluntly that it was a token of thanks for letting him do business.
However, that clearly excessive amount of takoyaki had already lost its heat, indicating whether I liked it or not that they were leftovers.
I tried to decline, but the man wouldn't listen, insisting that I didn't need to be modest.
To be honest, I didn't want them.
We continued that exchange for a while, but finally worn down, I ended up accepting that forbidden item.
It was because I was tired after the performance and wanted to get it over with quickly. ~To be continued~

"...What the hell is this?"
A scrap of paper titled "The Story of a Certain Man - Chapter 3" is lying here.
A locker for storing cleaning supplies and such.
Rags and buckets are inside.
Cleaning supplies are stored here.
A perfectly ordinary mirror.
Of course, it's not fogged up and is very clean.
A mirror is hanging on the wall.
Turning the tap produces cold water.
As expected, it might be a bit rough during this season.
The water has become very cold.
