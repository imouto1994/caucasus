IÅfve returned to my own room.
I don't really have anything to do here, but...
IÅfve returned to my own room.
I was about to open the door but suddenly stopped.
Ai-san is in my room right now.
I could just knock and have her open the door, but knocking suddenly might give her an unnecessary fright.
Besides... I still have things to do before returning to the room.
It's probably best to look around the interior a bit more until the power is restored.
I softly moved away from the door and headed for another location.
