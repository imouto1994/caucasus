I've returned to the dining room.
＃Protagonist
「Oh, where's Souko-san?」
Souko-san is nowhere to be seen.
＃Benio
「It seems she went back to her room.」
Benio-san is relaxing while drinking cocoa.
Tsujimura-san and Narumi-san aren't here either.
＃Benio
「I suppose she can't settle down in a place where a murderer might be lurking nearby.」
＃Protagonist
「How about you, Benio-san?」
＃Benio
「Me? ……Well, I suppose it's the same for me.」
＃Protagonist
「……Are you actually feeling anxious?」
＃Benio
「I am a delicate maiden, after all.」
Benio-san blurts out something unexpected.
No, she's right, but she has an air about her that makes it seem like she's almost enjoying this situation.
＃Protagonist
「……I see.」
Of course, I can't say that to her face, so I stay quiet.
With Rokuyou-san and Ai-san both murdered, there's no telling when Benio-san might be targeted.
＃Protagonist
「……Please be careful too, Benio-san.」
＃Benio
「What's this? Are you that worried about me?」
Benio-san's lips curl into a smirk.
＃Protagonist
「Of course I am.」
＃Benio
「……I see.」
Benio-san suddenly crosses her arms as if lost in thought.
＃Benio
「……Hey, are you——」
Benio-san's words are cut short by the sudden meow of a cat.
＃Benio
「……Are you worried too, Love?」
＃Benio
「Hehe…… I see.」
Benio-san picks up the cat.
＃Benio
「——I think I'll head back to my room as well.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so…… Um, about what you were going to say just now——」
＃Benio
「……It's nothing. Forget it.」
Benio-san turns her face away.
＃Protagonist
「I see……」
＃Benio
「Well then, see you later.」
Benio-san leaves the dining room.
I wonder what she wanted to say……
＃???
「……Um, are you finished?」
＃Protagonist
「Whoa!?」
Startled by the sudden voice, I turn around to find Akane-san standing there looking apologetic.
＃Protagonist
「A-Akane-san……」
＃Akane
「……I thought it would be rude to interrupt since you two seemed to be in your own little world……」
＃Protagonist
「……No, it wasn't anything like that……」
＃Akane
「I-Is that so……?」
How do I put it…… this person is pretty unusual too……
＃Akane
「Oh, that's right.」
Akane-san brings over a plate of fried rice.
＃Akane
「Um, I'd like you to take this to Takamine-sama's room, if you would……」
＃Protagonist
「Eh? But Takamine-san said he didn't want any……」
＃Akane
「Even so, he needs to eat. Please tell him that I've performed a poison test myself, so he can rest easy.」
＃Protagonist
「Understood.」
Well, it might be better for me to take it rather than Akane-san or someone else from this house.
