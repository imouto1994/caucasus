After parting with Benio-san, I went down the stairs.
Should I consult with Tsujimura-san as well...?
＃Protagonist
「Tsujimura-san.」
I called out to Tsujimura-san, who was at his desk.
＃Tsujimura
「Oh, is something the matter?」
＃Protagonist
「Did you see Akane-san? She's reportedly nowhere to be found this morning...」
＃Tsujimura
「Hiyama-san? ...Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her...」
＃Protagonist
「...It's possible she disappeared during the night.」
＃Tsujimura
「What... what does that mean?」
＃Protagonist
「...I don't want to think about it too much, but she might have been caught by the killer, or...」
Another possibility occurred to me, and I trailed off.
＃Tsujimura
「Or... what?」
＃Protagonist
「Or... she fled from this mansion.」
＃Tsujimura
「Fled...? But with this snow, she wouldn't be able to go anywhere...」
＃Protagonist
「...Yesterday, when we went to see the suspension bridge, Takamine-san said it. If there was no snow, you could climb down to the stream and walk...」
＃Tsujimura
「...It's not impossible. However, in this blizzard over the last few days, one would surely meet with an accident...」
＃Protagonist
「Layering inference upon inference might be meaningless, but if she did go outside, why would she have to go that far...?」
＃Tsujimura
「To call the police... or maybe...」
＃Protagonist
「Or what?」
This time, I was the one asking.
＃Tsujimura
「Or...」
Tsujimura-san simply went silent.
I had a vague idea of what he wanted to say.
Or... Akane-san was the killer and she fled.
I didn't want to think that.
Tsujimura-san likely didn't want to think it either.
That's why he trailed off.
If it hadn't been for last night, I wouldn't have even considered it.
Akane-san, who was doing something in the study.
Dr. Mikanagi said he didn't think she was doing anything wrong, but—in this situation, I might have no choice but to suspect her.
＃Protagonist
「...First, I'll search every corner of the mansion.」
＃Tsujimura
「Yes... that would be for the best...」
If she still wasn't found after that, what would it mean?
I didn't want to think about that yet.
