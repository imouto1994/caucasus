"Takamine-san was supposedly in his room… it’d be hard to pin it on him. For starters, he didn't even come to the second floor, right?"
#Satoshi
"True…"
#Maya
"I wouldn't know, I was resting in my room as well."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Ai
"I’m not sure… I was in my room the entire time."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Tsujimura
"I believe he was in his room… but I haven't confirmed it."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Takamine
"I was in my room the whole time. Though I doubt anyone can prove it."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Akane
"I believe he was in his room the whole time, but…"
#Satoshi
"I see…"
#Narumi
"I didn't see him once while I was out in the hallway. I’m pretty sure he was in his room the whole time."
#Satoshi
"I see…"
