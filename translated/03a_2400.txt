When I stepped into the corridor, I heard voices coming from the clinic.
It sounded like Benio-san and Dr. Mikanagi were talking.
＃Protagonist
"Good evening."
＃Mikanagi
"Did you find anything out?"
Having likely heard the story from Benio-san, Dr. Mikanagi asked me.
＃Protagonist
"I'm not really sure... it's a bit of a toss-up."
＃Mikanagi
"...We don't know if what you're investigating has anything to do with the current case. I can't exactly offer my support openly, but—"
＃Benio
"As long as there are no more victims, that's enough. People from the foot of the mountain should be coming at daybreak, after all."
＃Protagonist
"You're right..."
However, there was no reason to assume nothing would happen before dawn.
In fact—if I were the culprit, I would certainly take action.
Is it really okay to be investigating something like this at a time like this?
＃Benio
"If we make sure to stay in groups of two or three, we should be able to prevent any crimes regardless of who the culprit is... but it's already the middle of the night..."
＃Mikanagi
"We'll just have to do what we can with the people available. You're going to investigate that code, aren't you?"
＃Protagonist
"That's the plan, but..."
＃Benio
"You aren't exactly in a position of absolute safety either, so be careful."
＃Protagonist
"Yeah, I know."
Now that even Souko-san has been killed, I didn't feel like I was in a safe zone.
Now that Souko-san has received a warning as well, I didn't feel like I was in a safe zone.
＃Protagonist
"I plan to stick with Narumi-san for a while and investigate the code."
＃Benio
"With Narumi...? I see, understood."
Benio-san looked suspicious for a moment but nodded quickly.
＃Mikanagi
"Just please don't do anything reckless. I don't want to see you two become criminals as well."
＃Protagonist
"I know."
...Though I didn't know about Narumi-san, the self-proclaimed master thief.
