"So that was Shion-san's room... She's the only one made to live out in the annex."
#Protagonist
"Yeah..."
#Maya
"That is the room of my youngest daughter, Shion. Since she's frail, we have her live in the annex."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Ai
"...Yes, that is Shion's room. She's always lived there because of her weak constitution."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Benio
"The only way to get to the tower is through the door behind the office."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Shion
"...Because it's my room."
#Protagonist
"...Right, of course."
#Tsujimura
"With this snow, I'll have to do some shoveling myself. It would be terrible if Lady Shion were to fall."
#Protagonist
"Good point."
#Takamine
"...I'm told Shion-kun has lived in that tower for a long time."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Mikanagi
"I heard Shion-san lives in the annex because of her frail health... but perhaps my father was the one who gave those instructions..."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Akane
"I'm the one who brings Lady Shion her meals, but she usually eats them in the office."
#Protagonist
"Is that so..."
#Narumi
"Only Lady Shion lives out in the annex, doesn't she... It's kind of strange."
#Protagonist
"Yeah, it is..."
