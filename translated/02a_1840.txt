I returned to the front of my room.
I knocked on the door.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san, it's me. Please open up.」
...That's strange.
There was no response from inside.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san...?」
I twisted the doorknob, but it was firmly locked.
With trembling hands, I took out my key and inserted it into the keyhole.
The moment I entered the room, the first thing I saw was Ai-san collapsed facedown on the bed.
＃Protagonist
「Ai-san!?」
I rushed over in a panic and shook her.
＃Ai
「Mnh...」
＃Protagonist
「Sh-She's alive...?」
Seeing her stir slightly, I let out a sigh of relief.
Ai-san opened her eyes.
I could see a faint trace of tears at the corners of her eyes.
＃Ai
「Ah...」
＃Protagonist
「Eh?!?」
Suddenly, Ai-san lunged forward and hugged me.
＃Ai
「Uuugh... thank goodness... mnh, ugh... uuuugh...」
Ai-san clung to me and sobbed.
＃Ai
「Ugh... uuuugh... mnh, ugh...」
＃Protagonist
「...It's okay, Ai-san...」
I comforted her while stroking her head.
＃Ai
「I was... so scared, dark places... I've never been able to handle them... ngh... uuuugh...」
＃Protagonist
「It's okay now... just calm down.」
I continued to soothe the wailing Ai-san.
