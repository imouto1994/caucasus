I returned to the front of my room.
I knocked on the door.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san, it's me. Please open up."
...That's strange.
There was no response from inside.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san...?"
I twisted the doorknob, but it was firmly locked.
With trembling hands, I took out my key and inserted it into the keyhole.
The moment I entered the room, the first thing I saw was Ai-san collapsed facedown on the bed.
#Satoshi
"Ai-san!?"
I rushed over in a panic and shook her.
#Ai
"Mnh..."
#Satoshi
"Sh-She's alive...?"
Seeing her stir slightly, I let out a sigh of relief.
Ai-san opened her eyes.
I could see a faint trace of tears at the corners of her eyes.
#Ai
"Ah..."
#Satoshi
"Eh—!?"
Suddenly, Ai-san lunged forward and hugged me.
#Ai
"Uuugh... thank goodness... mnh, ugh... uuuugh..."
Ai-san clung to me and sobbed.
#Ai
"Ugh... uuuugh... mnh, ugh..."
#Satoshi
"...It's okay, Ai-san..."
I comforted her while stroking her head.
#Ai
"I was... so scared, dark places... I've never been able to handle them... ngh... uuuugh..."
#Satoshi
"It's okay now... just calm down."
I continued to soothe the wailing Ai-san.
