The world outside is a wall of white; I can't see a thing.
I wonder when this blizzard will finally let up...
The storm outside seems to be growing even more violent.
The fire in the hearth is burning brightly.
It likely stays lit all day long.
The fire is burning bright.
It's likely a cabinet for storing things like coffee cups.
I can't exactly go around opening things as I please, so I can't check the contents.
It appears to be a cupboard for cups and such.
A fine set of chairs and a table are laid out here.
I drank some tea here right after I arrived... I'm glad I didn't spill any.
It's a high-quality parlor set.
