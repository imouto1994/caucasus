「...It's possible Ai-san was in love with Rokuyou-san.」
＃Protagonist
「...That might be the case.」
＃Maya
「Ai was on good terms with Isamu-san... she might be the one most in shock...」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Benio
「Sister's hobbies aligned with Rokuyou's. It's no wonder she'd be in shock if he was killed.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Shion
「Sister Ai... she congratulated us on the marriage, but perhaps she was actually against it.」
＃Protagonist
「Is that so...?」
＃Tsujimura
「Lady Ai dotes on Lady Shion very much, so when she heard about the marriage, she likely felt very conflicted.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Takamine
「Lady Ai was apparently close with Rokuyou-kun. She might be feeling quite depressed right now.」
＃Protagonist
「I see...」
＃Mikanagi
「As for Ai-san, she should have gone to her room after seeing Shion-san off.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
＃Narumi
「Lady Ai? She's likely in her room.」
＃Protagonist
「I see.」
