"Akane-san hasn't been acting particularly strange, but we can't be too careful."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Souko
"I wonder why she disappeared..."
#Protagonist
"...I don't know."
#Maya
"Akane is a hard worker. She is very attentive to detail."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Maya
"Akane has vanished... surely, that child couldn't be...?"
#Protagonist
"...We don't know anything for certain yet."
#Ai
"Akane-san? She's an excellent worker."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Ai
"The fact that Akane-san disappeared... surely that means..."
#Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
#Shion
"Akane-san... she has always been kind to me."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
#Shion
"Akane-san... where on earth did she go...?"
#Protagonist
"...We don't know yet."
#Tsujimura
"...At any rate, I am glad Mistress Hiyama's injuries were not severe."
#Protagonist
"Yeah..."
#Tsujimura
"Where on earth could Mistress Hiyama have gone...?"
#Protagonist
"We don't know yet..."
#Takamine
"Whether Hiyama-kun being targeted is connected to you two being locked in the basement... you still don't know?"
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Takamine
"There are only so many places one can go in this mansion... why can't she be found?"
#Protagonist
"True..."
#Mikanagi
"I'm glad Akane-san's injuries were minor. ...I don't want to see any more victims, after all."
#Protagonist
"Me neither..."
#Mikanagi
"I wonder if it's because of what happened yesterday... her hiding herself away like that."
#Protagonist
"...Maybe."
#Akane
"My injuries are fine now. For now, let's... think about other things instead."
#Protagonist
"Right..."
#Narumi
"I don't think you need to worry about Akane's injuries."
#Protagonist
"I see."
#Narumi
"The reason she vanished, huh... She seemed to be looking into something, so maybe it's related to that... but it might be better not to jump to conclusions."
#Protagonist
"I see..."
