I began my move after everyone else had fallen asleep.
I slipped into the clinic and tampered with the medicine.
Since the "Bushi" used in herbal medicine has been processed to reduce its toxicity, it isn't as deadly as the original monkshood.
Still—no, that’s precisely why it was the perfect tool to make it look like she had staged her own incident.
"Oh—is something the matter?"
I stopped in my tracks at the sound of the voice. I had no choice but to stop. I couldn't afford any careless movements here.
I told her a lie, saying that I was hungry.
"Ah, if that's the case, please come to my room. I have some snacks at least."
I decided to take her up on the invitation.
Her body has its uses.
We chatted for a while in her room.
She told me all sorts of things.
That she had an older sister.
That her sister had worked at this mansion, but vanished after a "spiriting away."
It seemed she hadn't realized I’d been tampering with things in the clinic.
But even so, the decision to use her had already been made.
The two of us entered the kitchen.
There were plenty of weapons to be found here.
First, I struck her in the head to knock her unconscious.
Then, I stepped out through the side door and decapitated her in a spot that was hard to see from inside the house.
I covered the overflowing blood with snow to hide it.
I buried the severed head deep in the snow.
I covered the severed neck of the torso with a cloth, returned to the kitchen, and shoved it into the oven.
Before closing the lid, I grabbed her pinky finger and snapped it.
It made a sickening "pop" sound, more vivid than the sound of cutting her throat.
Judging from this morning's breakfast, they likely won't use this oven.
Still, just to be safe, I used a mallet to strike the latch on the oven lid, warping it.
This is fine. It would actually be better to burn her now, but that would throw too many things off.
So for now, I'll leave it like this so no one notices—
