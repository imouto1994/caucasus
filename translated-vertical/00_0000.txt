Having finished writing everything, he set down his brush.
This is enough—this will do.
Rather than wasting away from disease, he chose a death with pride.
$ Sitting shallowly in the chair, he let out a breath.
He was beyond exhausted.
His body felt heavy, like lead.
But even so, one final task remained.
He moved his failing body back to the bedroom and picked up the hemp rope he had prepared.
He tied loops on both ends, securing one side to the leg of the bed.
He opened the window.
The sky was choked with grey clouds.
$ He picked up a single snowdrop flower that had been resting in a vase.
In the end, he could find no hope for himself.
However, he could entrust that hope to those he was leaving behind.
$ He placed the rope around his neck and stood upon the window ledge.
Goodbye, my beloved daughters—
Hanging by the window, his body swayed in the wind.
He departed before the pain could even take hold.
Holding only that single snowdrop.
$ From the overcast sky, white flakes began to drift down.
The world was being filled with white snow.
It was as if an angel had come to take him home.
