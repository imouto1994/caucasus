I made my way down to the basement.
IÅfd already scouted out the fact that the power generation equipment was located here.
I attached a bypass wire to the fuse box to divert the current before prying the cover open.
Taking care not to shock myself, I replaced the internal fuse with one that had a much lower current rating.
I closed the lid and returned everything to how it was.
This should cause the fuse to melt and trigger a blackout right around the time electricity consumption peaks.
As I moved to leave the basement, I froze in front of the door.
ThereÅfs someone in the hall.
I didnÅft have a second to waste.
Waiting for the moment they turned away, I slipped out from behind the door.
I delivered a single, heavy blow to the back of their head.
After confirming they were sprawled out on the floor, I quickly dashed up the stairs.
I shouldn't have been seen.
If I was seen, the entire plan falls apart.
IÅfve already failed once, after all.
I entered her room.
She managed to survive once.
This will likely be the last chance.
The rest depends on how he decides to act.
He might be a bit more clever than I initially gave him credit for.
