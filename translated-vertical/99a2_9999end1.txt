Shion Nanatsuki was arrested for the murder of Isamu Rokuyou.
The defense attorney, Jin Takamine, tried to get her off by claiming she was not responsible due to insanity, but she refused.
She cooperated honestly with the investigation. The trial proceeded smoothly, and although there was some mitigation, she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
Shion was immediately sent to prison. The only people who came to visit her were Ai Nanatsuki and the servant, Seiji Tsujimura.
She was truly a model prisoner during her incarceration. It was just when it was thought her sentence might be reduced.
A physical examination revealed that she was pregnant—and had a brain tumor.
Regarding the pregnancy, she would not say whose child it was.
The problem more serious than that was the tumor in her brain. It was malignant, and treatment was almost impossible.
Shion was moved to the prison infirmary, where she received life-prolonging treatment. Although it was called life-prolonging, the actual goal was to keep her alive until she gave birth.
Summer passed, winter approached, and Shion gave birth to twins.
Immediately afterward, she ended her short life of about twenty years.
The remaining twins were taken in by Seiji Tsujimura.
He, too, had lost a daughter who had been ill for a long time.
He left the Nanatsuki house and reportedly moved to Tokyo.
$ A new year began, and spring arrived.
After graduating from university, Souko Kirihara left a message saying she was going on a journey and vanished.
Her whereabouts since then——no one knows.
