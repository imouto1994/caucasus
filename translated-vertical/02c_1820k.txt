Even after the lights in the room went out, I continued to wait perfectly still.
Eventually, she returned to the room, accompanied by him.
That was fine.
He was acting exactly as I had anticipated.
She locked the door to the room.
Now then——
I didn't care if I was seen.
Since I’d already failed once, I had to ensure I finished the job this time.
I dragged her unconscious body away.
I placed her body in the bathtub and wound a cord around her neck, tightening it.
She showed a brief reaction as if waking for a split second, but soon ceased moving altogether.
Just to be safe, I gagged her and began filling the tub with water.
I took out the saw and placed it against her neck, just below the ligature mark.
Fresh blood sprayed out.
The pooling water was instantly stained red.
I had stripped naked to ensure not a single drop of back-spray would get on my clothes.
Even if blood got on my body, I could wash it off immediately.
She seemed to have died from suffocation after all.
Even as the cervical vertebrae were sawn through, she showed no further reaction.
I wrapped the severed head in a cloth, opened the window, and hurled it far away.
I couldn't see well because of the blizzard, but it didn't look like any blood had dripped.
After that, I switched on the lamp by the bed to confirm the power hadn't returned, then tore the cord off and dropped the end into the water-filled tub.
I couldn't say it was a particularly meaningful act, but I was sure they would find some sort of meaning in it.
I could trigger another blackout if needed.
That way——I could establish an alibi in a natural fashion.
$ Now then——time to return to my room.
