It was when I was a few years past thirty that I, Seiji Tsujimura, married into the Nanatsuki family as a groom.
Until then, I had made a living composing music, occasionally traveling to Europe to deepen my friendships with colleagues there.
It happened after a concert held in Sendai. A beautiful woman approached me.
She was a sponsor of the concert. She said she was deeply moved by my compositions. I took it as a social pleasantry, but apparently, it was not so for her.
Later, I was invited to the Nanatsuki estate, and there, she proposed to me.
The Nanatsuki family was a matriarchal clan that had for generations taken husbands from the outside. I, attracted to her beauty, had no reason to refuse.
And so I was united with her, Maya Nanatsuki, and became Kousei Nanatsuki.
Our married life was happy. I was able to write music at my leisure, untroubled by the concerns of daily life.
I loved Maya deeply. However, for a long time, we were not blessed with children. That was my only regret.
I had a German friend named Dietrich Lische. He too was a composer, and his wife was a renowned singer.
It was several years after my marriage to Maya that news reached me that the two of them had met with an accident in Kobe.
Rushing to Kobe, I saw their two bodies and the daughter they had left behind.
I could not leave a kinless foreign child alone, so I brought her back with me to the Nanatsuki mansion.
Maya, who had no children of her own, was overjoyed, but at the time, I could not even suspect whether her feelings were sincere.
The girl’s name was Marino. Like her late mother, she was a girl with a very beautiful voice.
We intended to welcome her as an adopted child, but she adamantly refused, offering instead to work as a servant.
I felt she might have had a sense of inferiority as a foreigner. Perhaps because the fervor for war was rising at the time, there was a movement toward excluding foreigners.
Yet she was German, a person of an allied nation. There should have been no need for concern. However, she never nodded her assent.
Around the same time Marino came to the Nanatsuki house, my younger brother, Seiji, was hired as a servant.
He had been active as an aspiring painter, but after his daughter fell ill and massive medical expenses became necessary, I hired him.
Marino worked hard. She handled her duties far better than the servants who had been there before.
However, there was someone who did not look upon this with pleasure. None other than Maya. She repeatedly slandered Marino, claiming she was casting flirtatious glances at me.
It was merely her paranoia. She viewed the inability to conceive as her own fault and was losing confidence in her own fading body.
She began to exhibit eccentric behavior more frequently. She would wander at night and sometimes become violent.
It was a disease passed down through generations of the Nanatsuki family. The Nanatsuki family had repeatedly practiced consanguineous marriage for generations, and various abnormalities began to manifest because of it.
The matriarchal lineage was also one of those abnormalities. The fact that we could not conceive may also have been an influence of that.
Around that time, disappearances of young women began to occur one after another in the village. As the great landowners, the Nanatsuki family received requests for searches time and again.
I hesitate whether I should leave a record of what follows. Would such an act as accusing the wife I loved ever be forgiven?
However, I, who did not report her to the authorities at the time, am also burdened with heavy sin. I wish to make my confession by writing it here.
She, Maya Nanatsuki, was a vampire.
Of course, it is different from the vampire legends of the West. She is a full-fledged human. It is merely that the Nanatsuki blood is driving her mad.
She would bring young women to the mansion. Then she would enter through the door at the back of the machine room in the basement.
The girls never came back out. Maya alone would emerge, wearing a satisfied smile.
Once every few months, she would sip the blood of a young woman to purify her own tainted blood.
I turned a blind eye to her actions. If I endured it once, she would return to being the beautiful and gentle Maya once more.
Yet she too must have been unable to bear the weight of her remorse. Days when she did not bring a young woman continued for over a year.
I felt relieved. I thought the cursed blood had finally been purified.
But that was nothing more than a wish.
In the village, every household had become vigilant, refusing to let young women out of the house, or conversely, sending them to work in the city.
The reason she did not bring a girl was simply because no young woman could be found.
She no longer hid her thirst for blood. Finally, before my very eyes, she attacked Marino, who had grown into a beautiful woman.
I immediately isolated Maya. I had a tower built in the backyard and imprisoned her on its second floor.
In order to make her stop sipping blood, I invited a doctor named Shiro Mikanagi to attend to her treatment.
Whenever her spirit craved stability, she would inevitably seek my flesh. I did my best to respond to that. For I still loved her.
Let me record here the matter of this Nanatsuki family.
When I discovered this room, a single book had been left here. it was the secret of the Nanatsuki family, penned by successive heads of the house.
I read it and analyzed it in my own way. The cursed blood of the Nanatsuki family was breaking this small world.
The first head of the Nanatsuki family was devoted to occultism and painted the mansion where he lived black. This was the beginning of the Nanatsuki mansion.
To preserve pure blood, he lay with his own younger sister and had her bear a daughter. Furthermore, he shared intimacy with that daughter as well, attempting to create a clan through inbreeding.
To state the conclusion, that attempt ended in failure. Perhaps because of the original factors, after several generations, children with abnormalities began to appear.
The fact that only females were born is also thought to be because of that. Eventually, the Nanatsuki family began to exclude children who showed abnormalities.
To purify the tainted blood, children who showed abnormalities were made into 'Sacrifices.' They were placed in coffins and decapitated.
In an attempt to leave children who did not show abnormalities, blood was also added from the outside. However, the factors once left behind did not easily disappear.
Yet the times changed, and the 'Sacrifice' changed as well. It took the form of proving one’s tranquility during the marriage ceremony.
My wife, Maya, also entered a coffin during the marriage ceremony and spent a night there. Nothing happened that night, and her innocence was proven.
Yet her abnormality remained firmly within her.
Let us return to the story. Due to Maya’s condition, which showed no sign of recovery, my own spirit was gradually eroded by madness.
Once, and only once, I committed an error.
I had a relationship with Marino.
There is no excuse I can offer. I knew she harbored affection for me. But I thought it was a feeling toward fatherhood.
No, I was trying to think so.
Or perhaps Maya had noticed it. Was that the reason for her slander, and the reason for her madness?
If so, all that sin is my responsibility. I had to protect Maya and the Nanatsuki family from then on.
Yes, for the sake of the child to be born as well.
I was informed by my primary physician, Mikanagi, that Maya was pregnant.
Having been unable to conceive for many years, I had half given up, but when I learned the fact of her pregnancy, I was very happy.
There was no reason not to rejoice over a child conceived with my beloved wife.
From then on, Maya became as quiet as if she were a changed person.
No, she returned to the Maya of old.
However, that joy did not last long.
Marino vanished. The note left behind was unmistakably in Marino’s handwriting. No reason or anything else was written.
I exhausted every means to search for Marino’s whereabouts, but she was never found.
I suspected Maya. But she was filled with the joy of being blessed with a child. She seemed to have no concern for Marino.
I had layered sin upon sin again. I had suspected my beloved wife. Since she had been in the tower the entire time, there was no way she could have done anything.
Before long, the child was born. Marino was still a concern, but even so, the joy of finally being blessed with my own child was exceptional.
The daughter was named Ai and grew up healthy. Eventually, the second daughter, Benio, was also born.
Looking back now, that time must have been the peak of my happiness.
Of course, provided the matter of Marino were not considered.
After Benio was born, Maya emerged from the tower. Her obsession had subsided, and she seemed as fulfilled as a holy mother of mercy.
She seemed concerned that Marino was not in the mansion. However, she never questioned me about it.
That is why I felt at ease.
A short while later, a fire broke out in a mountain cabin located in the forest a short distance from the mansion.
A young man who happened to be passing by jumped into the flames and rescued the two children left inside.
However, the person who appeared to be their mother could not be saved and died.
The young man was Jin, the son of Takamine, who served as the legal counsel for the Nanatsuki family.
He suffered burns to his face.
Of the children, the older sister suffered terrible burns on her back.
When I laid eyes on those two daughters, I realized everything.
They were Marino’s daughters.
They were piteous twins brought into this world by my single error.
The mother who died was Marino.
Once again, I had layered sin upon sin through my own selfish actions.
I had to atone for my sins.
I took in the daughters who had become orphans and, this time for certain, made them properly our children.
$ Maya said nothing.
I named the older sister Kanon and the younger sister Shion.
I had Kanon, who was seriously injured and unconscious, admitted to a hospital in the city, and let Shion, who had lost all her memories, convalesce at the mansion.
Though Maya said nothing, she never bothered with Shion either. It was decided that Seiji would look after Shion.
Shion came to live in the tower where Maya had previously been imprisoned. I, burdened with heavy debt, could say nothing to Maya’s decision.
I was surrounded by my daughters, but I was no longer able to enjoy the same happiness as before.
For I had learned that the cause of Marino’s death lay with Maya.
Maya’s obsession had not vanished.
Upon learning of the relationship between Marino and me, Maya had tracked down Marino’s whereabouts and set fire to that mountain cabin.
From then on, I was merely a hollow shell spending sterile days. I wrote no music and merely breathed in vain.
Shion, who was imprisoned in the tower, had lost all pigment from her body.
Her white, transparent skin inevitably reminded me of Marino, making me even more melancholy.
In addition, news came from the hospital that Kanon had disappeared. What on earth had happened? I did not even know that much.
I was ill. Not only in spirit, but in body as well. In my gradually weakening body, I realized that illness was not the only cause.
My examinations were performed by Shiro Mikanagi. He was poisoning me.
Infinitesimal amounts of arsenic were mixed into my meals. Likely at Maya’s instruction.
However, the relationship between him and Maya was the factor that decisively broke me. The two daughters, Ai and Benio, were children conceived between Maya and Shiro Mikanagi.
Of course, the two children are blameless. I endeavored to maintain a facade of tranquility and interacted with my daughters.
However, there must have been a feeling somewhere that they were not my children. I feel truly sorry toward my daughters.
Yet, I wish to protect Shion at all costs. It is the last thing I can do, having failed to protect Marino.
I entrusted Shion to Seiji. My brother will surely protect Shion.
Rather than meeting a quiet death through debilitation, I choose a death with pride.
Let the one who reads this sever all the obsessions harbored by the Nanatsuki family and bring the truth to light.
You may laugh at my spinelessness.
My regret is that Kanon’s whereabouts are unknown. I pray she is alive and well. And I pray that she does not hate Maya.
$ Even at this late stage, I still love her.
