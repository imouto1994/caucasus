?I have finished everything I needed to do.
Just as planned from the beginning, I have stripped that woman of everything she loved.
...And yet, my mood did not brighten.
$ I suppose it's only natural.
Revenge is a meaningless thing, after all.
But... even though my heart felt no lighter, I was enveloped in a sense of accomplishment.
$ Because I have lived until now solely to achieve this.
Even so, the dead do not return.
But... no matter how meaningless it may be, it was certainly a vital compass for my life until now.
I have survived by swallowing mud all this time for the sake of this one moment.
But... as expected, it felt empty.
Returning to Tokyo, I continued my life as before.
I have become a sinner.
Even if no one in the world ever notices, within myself, I am a pure and simple transgressor.
No?perhaps he has noticed.
About the massive contradiction of the chapel key being left with Isamu Rokuyou's body when he was killed.
At that time, the chapel door I had checked was unlocked.
I realized everything at that point and thought of a way to use it to my advantage.
If he ever pursued me about that.
I would have used the saw I'd brought along to slit my own throat without hesitation.
Truthfully, I should probably do so even now.
However... I want to live just a little bit longer.
As long as he is by my side.
