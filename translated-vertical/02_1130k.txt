I stepped out of my room and headed toward the west corridor.
My preparations had been complete ever since the previous incident was discovered.
There was no way I could pass up such a perfect opportunity.
I slid the letter through the gap beneath her door.
I took great care to ensure the handwriting was unrecognizable.
I used a piece of paper that was easily obtainable by anyone in this house.
I immediately moved away from the door.
There was no one in the atrium on the second floor.
After confirming that no one was below either, I stepped through the door at the far end.
I climbed the ladder into the attic.
Lurking in the shadows, I gripped a wooden rod that had been rolling on the floor.
I had specified a time, but there was no guarantee she would actually show up.
If she didn't, I would just have to find another way.
I wondered how many minutes had passed.
I heard the sound of someone climbing the ladder from below.
It was best if she didn't realize I was here until it was too late.
The door creaked open, and she stepped inside.
She didn't seem to notice me, leaving her defenseless back completely exposed.
Without hesitation, I swung the wooden rod down.
She collapsed onto the floor in a heap.
I hadn't killed her yet—no, I couldn't kill her yet.
She had to be merely unconscious, and only for a short while.
I securely fixed the wire to a hook on the wall and wrapped it around her neck, carefully adjusting the length of the other end before catching it in the slowly turning gears of the clock mechanism.
This would do perfectly.
Once enough time had passed, she would die all on her own.
After descending, I used a length of wire to lash the attic doorknob to a nearby pipe.
Time to head back to my room.
I could have shown myself to him to establish an alibi, but that might actually make me more suspicious.
Not that I knew if he was sharp enough to even think that far.
