The sound of a lock turning echoed through the silent chapel.
The door opened slightly, and the light from the hallway spilled inside.
Someone had entered the chapel.
They moved toward the altar with stealthy footsteps, careful not to make a sound.
Reaching the casket on the altar, they gave the lid a light tap.
In response, the lid lifted just a fraction of an inch.
But it moved no further. With the strength of the young girl inside, the lid was simply too heavy to lift.
The lid was opened from the outside.
The girl slowly sat up and looked up at the person before her with a look of wonder.
She likely didn't understand why she had been woken.
The ritual was still ongoing.
The bride was meant to remain in the casket until dawn.
However, her groom had intruded upon the chapel, a place that should have been inviolable.
He toyed with a snowdrop flower between his fingertips as he placed a hand on the girl's shoulder.
The girl directed a frightened gaze toward her groom.
Suddenly.
He thrust his hand into the front of the girl's dress.
The girl let out a wordless scream and tried to brush his arm away.
But with the slender, weak arms of a frail girl, there was nothing she could do.
She was easily overpowered and pinned down to the floor.
The man's fingers began to grope the girl's body.
The girl was terrified by the lewd movement of those fingers.
He licked her neck with his tongue.
The sensation was like a snail crawling across her skin.
He whispered obscene words into her ear.
The girl did not know the meaning of those words.
But what she was told afterward filled her with a terror that froze her to the very core.
Not that.
That was the one thing no one could ever know?
The girl had a secret that she had to keep hidden at all costs.
His hand was crawling around near the base of the girl's thighs.
The girl found the sensation unbearable and tried to flee, clinging to him in desperation.
Her eyes suddenly caught sight of the man's neck.
A slender, white neck. A delicate body that didn't seem like that of a sailor.
Her own long hair was draped over it.
Without hesitation, the girl used both hands to pull the hair that was wrapped around his neck.
The man's body lurched.
Even as she felt like she was being crushed beneath him, the girl did not loosen her grip.
If she let go?he would surely do something even more terrible to her.
And besides, he would tell everyone about that secret?
The man struggled in agony for a while, but eventually, he stopped moving.
The girl crawled out from under the man's body.
She straightened her disheveled dress.
She checked the man's condition.
He wasn't breathing.
If he were to wake up, he would surely spread the secret.
$ The girl made the decision to kill him.
She dragged the man's body into the hallway.
The man's room was close by.
Taking the key from his clothes, she opened the door and pulled his body inside.
Leaving the room immediately, the girl headed toward the west wing of the mansion.
Light was leaking from the office.
To avoid being noticed, she entered the nearby storage room and took out an axe.
By the time she returned to the man's room, she was already exhausted.
The man had not yet woken up.
She had to hurry, or he would wake?
$ The girl dragged the man's body up onto the bed and placed a pillow over his head.
The girl believed that a human would not die unless their neck was severed.
That was what she had been taught?
That was how the heretics were made into sacrifices?
$ The girl swung the axe down toward the pillow.
Leaving the axe embedded where it landed, the girl lifted the man's head, which was wrapped in a cloth.
The severed head had to be kept separate.
As she was about to take it out, she heard voices outside the door.
The girl stopped and listened intently.
It was that person's voice.
The girl backed away.
If they were to come in here?would that person scold me?
That person was the one I didn't want to find out.
I didn't want them to know that I had killed someone who knew about our relationship.
After much deliberation, the girl threw the head she was holding out the window.
Then she closed the window and extinguished the fire in the fireplace.
Now, he would never wake up again.
After confirming that no one was in the hallway, she returned to the chapel.
There, the girl stopped in her tracks.
A snowdrop flower and the chapel key were lying on the floor.
These were things that hadn't been in the chapel originally.
They didn't belong here.
The flower had surely been arranged at the entrance.
She stepped back into the hallway and was about to open the door to the entrance when she realized.
Someone was over there.
If she went now, she would be seen.
The girl entered the room next door?the room of the man she had just killed?and left the flower by the body.
She placed the chapel key inside the man's clothes, returned to the hallway, and relocked the door.
She had no choice but to keep the key to this room.
Returning to the chapel once more and confirming that nothing was amiss, the girl climbed back into the casket.
She moved the heavy lid, and darkness enveloped her.
Finally feeling at ease, the girl was able to sleep.
