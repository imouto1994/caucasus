Shion Nanatsuki was arrested for the murder of Isamu Rokuyou, and Souko Kirihara for the murder of Ai Nanatsuki.
In both cases, Attorney Jin Takamine handled the defense.
Although they were rare murder cases, the sentences were lighter than expected, partly due to some room for circumstantial leniency.
Nevertheless, the two were imprisoned to serve their terms.
Both were model prisoners during their incarceration.
It was snowing on that day as well.
A woman emerged from the high, inorganic concrete walls.
She bowed deeply to the prison guard and turned toward me, holding a small handbag; her face was etched with an expression of shock.
「How are you??」
「……It’s been a long time.」
Meeting her again after almost ten years, she looked a little haggard, but she had aged beautifully.
「Why... why are you here?」
「……Isn't it obvious that I'm here? I’ve been waiting for you.」
I held out an umbrella toward her.
「……Wait.」
She looked down.
「……I've waited long enough.」
I gently placed a hand on her shoulder.
「I'm not even wearing makeup...」
「I don't mind.」
「Well, *I* mind, you dummy...」
Saying so, she hugged me while still looking down.
「Did you... get taller?」
「I'm not at that age anymore.」
I replied as I held her slender body tight.
「Welcome home, Souko-san??I’ve got some cola ready in the car.」
「Heh... thank you. You're quite thoughtful, aren't you?」
A gentle snow, different from that day, continued to dance softly through the air.
