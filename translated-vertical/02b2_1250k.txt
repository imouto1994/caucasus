After confirming that no one was around, I returned to the attic.
She, suspended in mid-air, didn't move an inch.
The gears of the clock had also ceased their movement.
As I untangled the wire caught in the gears, the corpse crumbled to the floor.
There was still work to be done.
I had also brought the hand axe IÅfd taken from the storage room.
$ I swung the axe down toward the neck of the corpse lying on the floor.
A dull thud echoed, and the head went rolling away amidst a spray of blood.
Taking meticulous care not to be splattered by the blood, I moved to the wall and opened the window.
The snow came billowing in.
I wrapped the head in a scrap of cloth and threw it toward a spot where the snow looked deep.
This will do.
With this?it will be perceived as a serial murder case.
